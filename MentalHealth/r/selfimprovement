A decent collection of crayons (half broken), a questionable skill in finger painting, and a stuffed bunny who’s seen better days.\n\nI’ve spent most of my days napping, eating snacks, and watching cartoons on loop. Sure, Paw Patrol is great, but is it *fulfilling*? Did I really need to cry over not getting the red sippy cup last Tuesday? Was that my legacy?\n\nMeanwhile, some kid on YouTube just unboxed their 37th Lamborghini Power Wheels. Another one solved a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded. And me? I still can't tie my shoes. Heck, I don't even wear shoes most days!\n\nI think it’s time to turn things around. No more throwing tantrums over bedtime. No more half-hearted scribbles. 2025 is going to be my year.\n\nAnyway, gotta go. My mom says I need to clean the yogurt I spilled on the dog. Again.",

        "title": "Quit smoking weed about a year ago and my life has improved tremendously. If you are also a chronic weed smoker, here’s some advice:",
        "text": "I used to be a chronic marijuana smoker. Used to smoke about 3/4 joints a day and was constantly hitting my bong. I used to think that it calmed me down, but over time, realized that it was the culprit behind most of my anxiety. Not only that but it also turned me into a paranoid overthinker. I just wanted to sit at home all day, never socialize and watch TV. I used to tell myself that it was because I enjoyed my own time and was mentally capable of being on my own. In reality, I had become lazy and mentally unable to socialize, as social situations began to trigger my anxiety.\n\nHere’s a few things I noticed a year after a quit:\n\n- Improved mental health \n- Improved performance at work \n- Became more proactive about pursuing my hobbies.\n- Thrived better in social settings because I wasn’t overthinking every last word and action \n- I would still have anxious thoughts, but it would only last a few moments rather than a few days at a time \n- Developed an “it is what it is” approach to life. If something bad happens, I don’t dwell on it anymore. Whenever I used to smoke, I would go through a matrix of everything that could possibly go wrong and get stuck in a panicked rut. \n- Improved physical health because I had more time to dedicate to myself than only looking forward to my next smoking session \n- Improved appetite and no longer had to rely on weed to enjoy food. \n\nSome of these improvements may have had nothing to do with quitting but all I know is that my life improved tremendously after the fact. It wasn’t an easy journey but eventually I got there. Now I only smoke if I’m in a social setting or on a trip. It’s usually just a few hits at a time. Some advice on how I managed to achieve this:\n\n- Don’t try to cut cold turkey. This never works and ends up making the cravings more intense. Start off by designating hours of the day for smoking. Perhaps only a few hours in the evening. \n- Gradually lessen the intensity of the weed you are smoking. If you’re smoking 24%, slowly reduce it down to 10-15% over time. \n- Take note of how your mental health is during the times that you are sober. Are you anxious? Are you paranoid about something? Are you overthinking? Do any of these things only happen when you smoke? If the answer is yes then keep reading. \n- Realize that there is a high in being sober and allowing yourself to feel normal. Trust me, it surpasses the fleeting thrill of being high, especially when your only excitement is anticipating your next smoke.\n- Incorporate more CBD into your weed and lessen the amount of THC you smoke. CBD will still give you that satisfaction of smoking but will give you a calm body high rather than a head high. \n- Allow yourself to smoke once in a while but mainly in social settings. \n\nIf anything I have said resonates with you, follow the advice I left. If you are able to smoke without any of the negative side effects then by all means, continue as you are. Hope this helps! ",

        "text": "I have struggled with sleep for 15 years. A little over 5 years ago I became obsessed with fixing this issue... since then I have tried every pill, hack, system, etc in the books...\n\nI recently cracked the code. It has absolutely changed my life. I am more productive in the mornings, have more energy throughout the day, and stay so much more focused.\n\nI honestly thought I was just going to have to deal with terrible sleep my entire life, and was pretty depressed about it at one point. So, let me know if you have any questions, would love to help!\n\n# Summary:\n\n**How I sleep now:**\n\n* 7-8 hours solid most nights of the week\n* I don't take any sleeping meds or melatonin\n* I wake up feeling refreshed and motivated\n\n**How I used to sleep:**\n\n* Sleep 3-4 hours, awake 1-2 hours, then sleep 2-3 hours\n* This meant I needed to be in bed 9+ hours just to feel remotely OK\n* Always woke up tired, and felt like I would drag through the day\n\n**How it impacted my day-to-day:**\n\n* I used to only have a few good hours of focused work in me in the morning\n* Then, I would crash and feel like I had to force myself to work the rest of the day\n* Now, I can tap into a focused mode throughout the day and even in the evening if I need to\n* I am not as stressed by work, or any of the little things in life, everything seems easier\n\n# A Quick Disclaimer\n\n**Before I get to the \"how\":**\n\n* I will share what works for me, but one key point (and paradox is) — sleep is about letting go\n* You can overthink sleep habits easily and it can actually have an opposite effect\n* I would recommend testing these and making it a fun experiment to see what works for you\n* The more pressure you put on sleep, the more elusive it becomes\n\n# The Basic Sleep Advice:\n\nYou have probably heard most of this if you've done any digging on reddit, but it's worth repeating since I do all of these things as much as possible.\n\n* No stimulants after noon (in my case no caffeine period)\n* Eat last meal at least 2 hours before bed\n* No bright lights, or blue light from screens after sunset\n* Wear blue light blockers if you have to be on screens\n* No doom scrolling after dinner (read instead)\n* Avoid alcohol before bed\n* Keep it cool\n* keep it dark\n* Take Magnesium Glycinate before bed\n* Sweat and get exercise every day\n* Be outside during sunset (and sunrise if possible)\n* Use earplugs, white noise, and eye mask\n* Go to bed around the same time \n\n# The Advanced Sleep Advice:\n\n**Waking up is OK and it's never perfect**\n\n* Your sleep comes in cycles, so it's natural to wake up some\n* But, you should fall back asleep quickly and easily ideally\n* Even now, I still have 1-2 nights a week where I don't sleep great\n\n**Grounding sheets**\n\n* The studies on these are fascinating\n* Whether you buy into the science or not...\n* just trust me and make the investment\n\n**Break your phone addiction**\n\n* If your mind is conditioned to be overstimulated, it's impossible to get good sleep\n* I block distracting apps completely before 9AM and after 6PM\n* Limit myself to \"10 unblocks\" on social media during the day\n\n**Fall back in love with sleep**\n\n* May sound strange, but you can reframe your thoughts on sleep\n* Look forward to the dreams, the rest, the time to do nothing\n* Pretend you have to \"court sleep like a lover\"\n\n**Develop a ritual**\n\n* A wind down routine will prepare your mind and body\n* \"Build a ramp\" to your sleep (ex: start moving slower at night)\n* Ex: Dinner > Walk > Shower > Stretch Read\n\n**Make your sleep space sacred**\n\n* Clean your room, declutter the space\n* Get a diffuser, salt lamp, or whatever feels right\n* Don't watch TV or do (most) other things in bed\n\n**Get off the sleeping pills**\n\n* I never found a sleeping pill that didn't leave me feeling groggy\n* Taking melatonin will train your body not to produce as much naturally\n* It may take time, but you are better off without it long term\n\n**Eat clean**\n\n* heavier meals, and food from restaurants can disrupt sleep\n* If possible, organic or non-gmo food\n* ideally all the time, but especially your last meal\n\n**Meditation and journaling**\n\n* developing a daily meditation practice has huge long term benefits\n* If your mind is \"full\" when you start to wind down for bed...\n* write everything down in a journal, meditate, and release it for tomorrow\n\n**Forget the sleep tracking**\n\n* I tracked my sleep for years but it had a negative overall impact\n* There were a few good insights early (ex: alcohol ruins sleep)\n* but, I'd wake up and think \"did it register that\"\n* I realized I'm better off letting go of the data in this case",

But it would also seem the person on the other side of that conversation has to take some ownership of the problem here. You see, I agree with you that talking about yourself way too much can come across as obnoxious, but there’s some context that needs to be taken here. Sharing your thoughts, experiences or opinions about things often, is a great way to iterate your points. For many, this is an attempt to display sincere empathy and enthusiasm for what someone else is taking about. It does require effective punctuating though and not to be used in every sentence, of course. Generalising this concept risks turning big and exciting characters into censored, repressed individuals. Sharing experiences is totally fine, and using it to try to understand someone else’s point of view, or engage in conversation is actually a great way of communicating. Just don’t be boastful, or change the conversation topic to your stories. Encourage the continuance of the conversation instead and request feedback about what you just said to deflect attention back. For example, as the other person if you were accurate in thinking the feelings you spoke about were like theirs by saying things like ‘is that what you meant by that?’ or ‘was your experience similar to mine?’ That way you don’t come across as obnoxious anymore, rather you come across as interesting but also engaged with the conversation. \n\nAlso, if you’re on the other side of this type of conversation habit, try to read more into the nuances of what they’re saying. You might be surprised by what you find. Maybe they’re trying to impress you, or they want you to like them. Maybe you’ve hit a nerve, or triggered a powerful memory. Try not to assume people using this conversation habit are self centred, most people aren’t in my experience. \n\nFunnily enough I’m going to do it myself now, I also experienced what you’re talking about. I used to talk about myself in the wrong types of way all the time, I was frequently called arrogant and it did warrant a desire in me to change my conversation habit. But I never felt like I was being self centred, I’d always thought I was trying to contribute value in the conversation. But it did turn out I hadn’t done it in the right way. And it still is a bad habit of mine at times. I guess the truth of it is, I’m simply not the best conversationalist."

        "text": " \n\n**Everything is Temporary:** \n\nWhen I was in prison, it felt like I would be there forever. That my permanent state of being was uncertainty and pain. I felt as though I would be worthless for the remainder of my life.  Once I looked beyond the fear and anxiety, I understood there was an expiration date. I didn't know when, but I knew there was one. That alone gave me the strength to endure.  This is the power of impermanence.\n\n**Our Perspective Dictates our Reality:**  \n\nIs this happening to you? Is this happening for you? One is playing the victim, the other is taking responsibility for your life. The moment I dropped the victim role (which I played for a while), I found freedom - inside prison. This is our choice.\n\n**Choice is Freedom:** \n\nI found \"Man's Search for Meaning\" in the prison library. It's one of the most profound perspective shifting books I have ever read. I reread it once a year. This quote is one of many reasons I make that claim. \n\n\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nWhen we embrace choice, we have agency over our lives.  When we have agency over our lives - we can rebuild. We can start over. \n\n**Gratitude is a Superpower:** \n\nI was sitting in the prison library, with nothing to my name. I lost everything. My amazing wife, my career, my money, my homes, and cars. I lost my identity and self-worth. And yet, one crisp early morning, the sunrise was spectacular. I put pen to paper and wrote, \"I'm grateful for this morning's sunrise.\" \n\nI found something to be grateful for in my most challenging time. I cannot express how important that truly is. \n\n**Adversity Can Be a Gift:** \n\nOur greatest adversities do not have to be the end. In fact, they can be our greatest teachers and our greatest beginnings. The choice is ours. It begins when we embrace the other 4 lessons.",

        "title": "Women don't like Nice Guys. Women like good men.",
        "text": "**Distinguishing the key differences between Nice Guys and genuinely good men.**\n\nIn this world, there is a subset of men that believe women are only attracted to assholes.\n\nWhich is true, if you preface this belief with 'very few'.\n\nThe vast majority of women are attracted to good men.\n\nThe subset of men that believe otherwise are Nice Guys.\n\n## What's a Nice Guy?\n\n## Nice Guy: (noun)\n\nA man that displays overwhelming acts of kindness towards women, with a firm expectation of immediate romantic or sexual rewards.\n\nSome of the common traits of a Nice Guy include:\n\n## He puts women on a pedestal\n\nNice guys are prone to putting women on a pedestal. They do so to the point of making a woman uncomfortable, or worse, bored.\n\nThey will 'coincidentally' have all of the same hobbies and interests as her.\n\nThey will agree with all of her world views and personal opinions.\n\nThey refuse to say anything that could offend her (up until the point she rejects him, but we'll get to that in a moment).\n\nThey are at her beck and call whether or not she becks or calls for it. \n\nThey constantly fawn over her.\n\nThey laugh too loudly at her throwaway jokes.\n\nThey drown her in unnecessary flattery.\n\n## He's dishonest\n\nNice Guy's are dishonest by nature.\n\nThey pretend to agree with everything a woman says.\n\nThey deceive women through the use of emotional manipulation.\n\nThey falsely big-note themselves to women.\n\nThey literally tell women: 'I'm a good guy'.\n\nNice Guys are dishonest.\n\n## Being a sore loser\n\nWhen a nice guy faces rejection from a woman, his response generally involves a two-step approach:\n\n## 1. He initially ignores it.\n\nA Nice Guy will relentlessly continue his pursuit of a woman, despite any subtle, initial signals she gives off that she's not interested.\n\nAs such, women are eventually pushed to the point of forcefully spelling it out to him: 'I'M NOT INTERESTED, LEAVE ME ALONE'.\n\n## 2. He throws a tantrum\n\nOnce a Nice Guy realises defeat, he doesn't keep his cool and move on from the rejection with grace and civility.\n\nHe burns the bridge between him and her until there is nothing left but the charred remains of his bruised ego.\n\nHe calls her a prude or a slut (or sometimes both, unaware of the irony).\n\nHe makes nasty comments about her personal appearance.\n\nFinally,then he caps it off with something along the lines of: 'I'm out of your league anyway.'\n\nHere is an example of how this could play out in an online dating scenario:\n\nNice Guy: Hello Emily, you have beautiful eyes.I should tell you, I'm not like most guys.I know how to treat a girl right. If you go out with me, I'll be the one in the kitchen making YOU a sandwich! Hehe...\n\n**Emily: Hey, thanks for the compliment.**\n\n**Nice Guy: You're welcome.So, what sort of sandwich can I come over and make for you tonight?**\n\n**\\*15 minutes pass\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: Hello?**\n\n**Emily: Hey, sorry, I'm at work.I appreciate the offer, but I just got out of a relationship, and I'm not really ready to meet up with any guys just yet.** **Nice Guy: Well that's good, cos I'm not just any guy. Hehe.How about we take it slow then. Let me take you out for a coffee.**\n\n**Emily: As I said, I'm not ready for that yet.**\n\n**Nice Guy: Come on, I promise I'm a good guy.**\n\n**Emily: Look, I'm not interested, ok? Sorry.**\n\n**Nice Guy: Ok, fine. Jeez. Just trying to be nice.**\n\n**\\*15 minutes pass\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: I bet you'll end up dating some jobless loser who treats you like shit.** \n\n**\\*1 hour passes\\***\n\nNice Guy: **No wonder your last boyfriend left you.Women only date asshole losers. If you don't want to meet any guys, then why the fuck are you on this app in the first place?**\n\n**\\*1 hour passes\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: Fine, don't respond. Slut.**\n\nThis sort of interaction begs the question: If women are only attracted to assholes, why aren't they swooning over Nice Guys? Because they mostly don't.\n\n## He has no respect for women\n\nDeep down, Nice Guys have no respect for women. \n\nThis is apparent when you witness the Jekyll to Hyde transformation a Nice Guy makes whenever a woman rejects him.\n\nIt is also apparent with the overwhelming approach Nice Guys take to their pursuit of a woman.\n\nMen who respect women don't check in on them every ten minutes, nor do they leave women banks of 4 unresponded text messages on the regular. \n\nThis sort of behaviour is invasive, uncomfortable and ultimately, disrespectful.\n\n## He's completely unaware of himself\n\nNice Guys seldom accept fault when a woman rejects them.\n\nThey refuse to consider: 'If I keep sending women uncomfortably flattering messages and not a single one of them responds positively, maybe that's on me?'\n\nInstead, a Nice Guy carries on recycling the same tired, empty messages, growing more resentful with each rejection he receives in response.\n\nA Nice Guy's inability to self-reflect and self-improve condemns him to a life of bitter cynicism and exponentially painful rejection.\n\n## Are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?\n\nNow that you've read through some of the typical traits of a Nice Guy, you're probably wondering: 'are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?'\n\nWhile many Nice Guys have always been selfish, cynical pricks, not all of them were born this way. Some are newly Nice Guys.\n\n## What's a newly Nice Guy?\n\nNewly Nice Guys are those that began their dating life as insecure, misguided young men and devolved into Nice Guys over time.\n\nLet me show you an example of how this happens.\n\nIn this example, I'll call our pre-Nice Guy, Guy.\n\n***Guy starts speaking to a woman.***\n\n***He is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***\n\n***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***\n\n***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and confused as to why she rejected him. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***\n\n***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***\n\n***Guy starts speaking to a new woman.***\n\n***Just like last time, he is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***\n\n***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***\n\n***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and even more confused as to why it happened. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***\n\n***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***\n\nAs this pattern continues, Guy becomes a little more cynical and a little more frustrated each time.\n\nEver heard of the saying: The definition of madness is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?\n\nWell, that's spot on in the case of how some men become newly Nice Guys, and how Nice Guys stay Nice Guys.\n\nThey continue the same lazy, ill-conceived attempts at seduction over and over, expecting someone will eventually take the bait.\n\nAs the rejections pile up, they develop a resentment towards women, become sore-losers and convince themselves into believing that the only reason women don't like them, is because women are only attracted to assholes.\n\n## Let's talk about good men\n\nNice Guys and good men are polar opposites.\n\nWhile a Nice Guy is disrespectful, insincere, overly agreeable and selfish, a good man is respectful, confident, honest and selfless.\n\nSome of the common traits of a good man include:\n\n## He carries out acts of kindness with no ulterior motive\n\nGood men don't hold the door open for women or compliment their smiles, as a way to get her into bed.\n\nA good man displays acts of kindness towards women because being kind and respectful is in his nature.\n\nWomen appreciate acts of kindness when they sense that it's being delivered in a sincere, ulterior free manner.\n\nSincere gestures from a man lower a woman's defences and increase his credibility in her eyes.\n\n## He treats women as individuals\n\nUnlike Nice Guys, (who let their negative experiences with a few women dictate their views on all women) a good man treats women on a case by case basis.\n\nThis is beneficial, regardless of the outcome of his past encounters with women.\n\nWhen a past encounter was negative, he doesn't project his baggage onto the next woman.\n\nWhen a past encounter was positive, he doesn't set unrealistically high expectations upon the next woman.\n\n## He's a good loser\n\nWhen a good man gets rejected by a girl, (yes, it does happen) no matter how painful it feels, he knows when to call it quits, accept the loss and move on.\n\nHe won't respond to her rejection message demanding she explains herself further.\n\nHe won't accuse her of disliking him because he treated her too well.\n\nHe won't send her insulting messages until she elicits an emotional response.\n\nHe's too busy getting back on his feet and finding somebody else.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *The recovery time from a break-up is dependent on the length and nature of the relationship. I'm not suggesting good men move on from every rejection quickly and effortlessly.*\n\n## He doesn't dote on women\n\nGood men are rarely accused of appearing desperate in their pursuit of a woman.  This is namely because a good man won't dote on a woman.\n\nBefore he compliments her, he senses that the situation calls for it.\n\nHe won't show strong affection towards a woman until he feels the relationship has developed to the point where his affection will be well received and reciprocated.\n\nHe doesn't treat women like poor, lost puppies, as he sees them as adults who are capable of looking after themselves.\n\n## He is always looking for ways to improve\n\nGood men are naturally self-reflective beings.\n\nWhen a good man realises his shortcomings or is faced with rejection, he makes a concerted effort to confront his shortcomings and improve himself.\n\nThis is vastly different from Nice Guys, who prefer to blame their problems on everyone else.\n\n## He challenges women\n\nGood men won't enthusiastically agree with everything a woman says and does. If he disagrees with something she's said, he will make it known, respectfully.\n\nGood men also aren't afraid to make fun of a woman (in a fun and playful way). \n\nExamples of this include: 'I'd ask you to dance, but you couldn't handle my moves' or 'I don't think you and I are going to work out, we should call it quits now' (after she reveals she doesn't like Nando's)\n\n## He is self-assured\n\nGood men know their worth and remind themselves of it often.\n\nThey won't bend at the will of others or let 'haters' alter the views they have of themselves.\n\nThey hold strong to their values and express them with women in a mature are rational manner.\n\n## He respects women\n\nGood men view women as their peers.\n\nBy treating women as their peers (which, in fairness, all men rightfully should), good men reap 2 benefits:\n\n1. They don't run the risk of becoming subservient to a woman.\n2. They don't view women as inferior by expecting immediate gratification for their attempts at seduction (therefore their expectations aren't constantly crushed, leading them down a hateful emotional spiral ala Nice Guys.)\n\n## He owns his insecurities\n\nBeing a good man doesn't mean being free from insecurities.\n\nSure, the average good man has far fewer insecurities than the average Nice Guy, but still - he does have them.\n\nThe difference is, he's not afraid to admit them.\n\nWhere a Nice Guy will channel his insecurities into bullying others and bringing them down, a good man owns his insecurities and looks to address them in a healthy manner.\n\nThe way a good man owns his insecurities is by:\n\n\\- Being open about them and seeking counsel from friends on them\n\n\\- Considering ways he can alleviate his insecurities by improving himself\n\n\\- Developing strong empathy and understanding for the insecurities of others, based on those he sees in himself\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nWhile the traits listed above provide an underlying framework of what makes a Nice Guy vs. what makes a good man, the world is not so black and white.\n\nSome good guys have moments of weakness, just as some Nice Guys have moments of clarity and good.\n\nIf you are guilty of a few Nice Guy traits and you fear you could become a full blown Nice Guy, please know - there's still a chance for salvation.\n\nMy advice to you is to change your mindset and attitude towards women, but firstly - towards yourself.\n\nIf you don't,  you are likely to live a life filled with romantic rejection and increasing bitterness towards yourself and others.\n\nNice Guys, start being good men.\n\nGood men, keep up the good work.",

        "title": "Quick n Dirty Guide: How to get your life together(ish)",
        "text": "**Documents/Administration:**\n\n1. Insurance *(car insurance, health insurance, dental insurance, homeowner, pet, etc.)*\n2. Figure your finances out *(learn basics; credit cards, 401(k), savings, rrsp, etc.)*\n3. Medical appointments *(optometrist, dentist, psychologist, yearly checkup etc.)*\n4. A plan for debt *(there is good debt and bad debt but debt is debt, nevertheless. Plan to get out, even if its a baby step ahead).*\n5. Taxes *(check on your taxes, make sure everything is correct and keep on top of it)*\n6. Have an income (*even if its a cashier job- it's still an income. Never underestimate a step forward)*\n7. Check your document expirees *(passports, licenses, credit cards, etc.)*\n8. Put all important documents split in specific locations *(specifically: passports, licenses, social security, birth certificate, marriage license, tax returns, registration, finance records)*. **Suggest putting these in TWO different places, in case of a robbery or some unseen event. If something happened to one batch of documents, the second set is there to validate your identity.**\n9. Go make copies of all those documents and put these physical copies in a third location.\n10. Appoint someone you trust with your passwords. If your computer has a lock, give a physical copy in case something happens to you, so they have access to these types of information.\n11. If there is something very important you need to tell someone before you pass away, write it down and put it aside just incase.\n\n**Immediate Rules:**\n\n1. Keep spaces and items, clean.\n2. Make a healthy lifestyle (especially eating)\n3. Enforce sleeping rules (If you are having sleeping issues, investigate asap.)\n\n**Healthy Lifestyles:**\n\n1. Floss. Nothing makes you feel like you have your life as put together, then flossing. You can buy the stick applicators that are way better. If you're doing that, you may as well get mouthwash.\n2. If you're flossing and doing mouthwash, may as well wear your retainer.\n3. Make your bed everyday.\n4. Buy a tool to measure your personal activity (an app, fitness watch, etc.)- wear it constantly.\n5. For those sleep deprived: blackout curtains, ear plugs, satin pillows, weighted blankets, stuffed animals, white noise, asmr, no technology 1 hour before bed, reading before bed or natural supplements can help a lot. If you're getting tired after you're eating: this is often a symptom of a food allergy, food insensitivity or overindulgence.\n6. Make a skincare routine.\n7. Buy new socks and underwear.\n8. Put a counsellor/psychologist on your yearly checkup list\n\n**Career/Income/Growth:**\n\n1. Have an income\n2. Make a huge goal within reasonable limits (huge goal does not mean being a CEO- it's what's meaningful to *you).*\n3. Make smaller goals to get there\n4. Make smaller goals for you to personally enjoy\n5. Write down the things that would impress you, if you achieved. Pin it physically to a board.\n6. Get a whiteboard/corkboard or something you can physically see items written down everyday\n7. Mentioned above, make a plan for your income. Even if its 1$ saved a week- that's still 365$\n\n**Emotional/Mental Wellbeing:**\n\n1. Get your phone out and put your loved ones birthday in your calendars. Add important events.\n2. Add in your phone a once a month reminder to check in with loved ones to see how they're doing\n3. In that calendar, make a note if one of your friends is going through a hard time, set a reminder to check in on them.\n4. Figure out what you want in life, especially dating. If you don't figure out what you want, you make yourself vulnerable to being used or being misguided.\n5. Identify (or try) your Achilles heel. What are you bad at? Just keep this in mind for later development.\n\n**Overnight Change:**\n\n1. Donate the pieces in your wardrobe that aren't you anymore. Start getting pieces that are. Think about where those items are also coming from; consider secondhand.\n2. Start reading, get a bookshelf and begin to fill it with things you love.\n3. Do what you want with your appearance as long as it's in alignment with your goals/vision for yourself.\n4. Volunteer even if its just 3-4 hours a week. Retirement homes and aging populations, are some of the most valuable connections you can have.\n5. Go to the gym, watch what you eat, do all the advice reddit prescribes.\n6. Go out of your way to teach someone something, even if its just a tutorial. This will help you grow confidence in your own knowledge, sharpen communication and help connect to others.\n\n**Checkbox Lists That Will Start To Change Your Day:**\n\n1. The 15 things you are afraid of list. Great, now go do most of them.\n2. The 3 things you should have done but ignored, list. Great, now go do them.\n3. The 3 things you wanted to do this year but haven't got around too (make sure they're fun).\n4. Not a checkbox: The last 4 years of bad decisions you made and beside them, why you made it. Sit with that uncomfortable feeling for awhile and accept responsibility. If you do not learn, the universe will try to teach you again.\n5. When you're done with those lists, print out a monthly calender and jot down some important things you need to do. After you do that for awhile, make a weekly to-do list, eventually a daily one should result. Checkboxes are your friend and give you dopamine.\n\n**Things I Had To Learn The Hard Way (that I hope you'll avoid to make this world a better place)**\n\n1. Always attend the wake and/or funeral. People die once. Stop being selfish and think of others. You will never regret going.\n2. Give more than you take.\n3. When you fail to make a decision, the universe will make it for you. It may be the wrong one, still. When you are too indecisive and finally make a decision last minute, the weight of that decision will often come back to you, like a slap in the face. It's okay to be wrong and make mistakes.\n4. Hold yourself to a high standard and if no one is telling you that you can do better, I am.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Common Bad Habits**:\n\n1. Unplug preferably from social media. If not, limit to 30 minutes.\n2. Quit ideally daydreaming, moreso when you have other things you should do or work towards\n3. Stop applying all your time to something that has little feedback (videogames- add another hobby)\n4. Stop staying up late at night\n5. Quit feeling sorry for yourself and if you can't stop (we've all been there), go listen to someone else for awhile.\n6. Failing to think/check in/consider other people on a frequent basis\n7. Running away from your problems through travelling, instagram, netflix, drugs, booze, dating etc. Stop turning your brain off all the time. You have good ideas up there.\n8. Monitor your recreation\n9. Being bad with finances (this is not the same as poverty)\n10. Comparing yourself to others.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Small Things That Will Pay Off**:\n\n1. Go learn basic history- especially go learn basic history of the last 75 years\n2. Have a basic knowledge of finances, housekeeping, driving, changing tires, etc.\n3. Have a basic knowledge of common mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, bipolar, narcissism etc.)\n4. Ask your parents things you wanted to know; record a message from them, even if its something small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the pms, comments and awards. Hope this helps you. Made this list while just checking over things in my own life. It's not about implementing every single one but slowly integrating these into your daily life. Motivation is a poor mans discipline.",

I had the fear to start from the bottom.\n\nIf I’ll start from scratch some “Bob” will be 3 years ahead of me in life quality, finance and achievements.\n\nI couldn’t let it happen so I stayed at a job that I hated. Just to not feel like I was behind someone.\n\nHow did I overcome it? **I stopped comparing myself to others**\n\n# 4. Don’t rely on anyone but yourself\n\nJust remember that no one will save you.\n\nLuck won’t save you.\n\nYour job won’t save you.\n\nThe government won’t save you.\n\n**Only you can change your life.**\n\nConsistent work and ambitions will get you to your goal.\n\n# 3. Don’t afraid to ask\n\nI lost many opportunities in my life because I was afraid to ask.\n\nI was afraid to get rejected. I was afraid of others’ opinions.

Last year I decided to do everything possible to change, I enrolled in Uni and forced myself to go out (one year and 3 months ago didn’t left my house for 4 months).\n\nEverything was forced and didn’t see much improvement, until 5 months ago: I stopped smoking weed, I started reading a lot (books and audiobooks), I started cutting toxic people off (I’ve always been a people pleaser), started taking care of myself, going to gym, left a toxic situationship, started some side projects.\n\nAnd now I just realized that the last 5 months were the best ever.\n\nAll of that came naturally, I understood that in order to change action is required.\nStarting out one year ago every change seemed impossible, but now it changed, it feels natural. \n\nThe best thing to do when you feel completely lost, is the philosophy “fake it ‘till you make it”, as soon as I started forcing myself to think about myself in a good way, even just a few minutes a day (and it was fake, I didn’t believe that), the change happened.\n\nOur thoughts define who we are, the change begins in our minds.\n\nI just wanted to share this here hoping this could be a small help for someone.

Finally when finishing a hard workout you feel accomplished and particularly when fully pumped and exhausted but standing alive it's like the war is won for the day.\n\nFor meditation you will be fine with trying it out. Almost everyone recommends some form of mindfulness but the process for that is different than working out since mindfullness is about putting in directed effort but subtly to maintain focus/concentration/and sustain stable attention on a meditation object such as nostril breathing our mouth breathing. Of course the side effect of this is a relaxation on mind and body combined with the feeling of mental lightness as ones thoughts are observed like wispy strings. So the style is different then working out where working out is more about rae exertion. With that being said meditation is also in its own ways pretty exertion heavy and demanding but the long term benefit is relaxation, mental alertness, and positive sensations. \n\nGive it a shot.\n\n\nWhen doing meditation create a routine similar to working out. Do not force progression based on minutes of feelings of sensations. The goals should be that of a beginner so every 6-12 weeks you can change the regiment and style. For the beginner stages the only thing one should worry about I'd some consistency which is 3-5 times per week at a rate of max 30 mins spaced out throughout the day. After that one can develop longer sits and progression. Just use an app until 3-6 months and then ditch it for some textbooks or some skilled guides. The main thing is strive for effortlessness which means the session should not be filled with exertion. \n\nFinally I will say this. One caveat is that even though meditation does produce a calming sensation and cultivates various mind states don't try to cling to the feelings. Just focus on the process/practices."

Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.\n\nIf you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take Baldwin's words to heart - **whatever you may feel in your life is unfixable may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with.** Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.",

I feel like a lot of us let insecurities from our teen years still sway many of our life choices, even if we aren't getting any happiness out of it. After everything I've experienced and learnt from life since that age, I know now that the person I wanted to be back then sucks, and the lifestyle I wanted for myself was superficial, lonely and meaningless. Sure, you can always \"grow up later\" but I believe if it's something you won't be proud to still be doing when you're 30 that doesn't bring some form of meaning to your life, you shouldn't waste your time doing it now. Get a head start on being someone you will be proud of when you're 30, rather than chasing who you wanted to be at 15.\n\nEdit: For anybody over 30 feeling left out, I just wanted to say that 15 and 30 were just ages I randomly chose because I'm in between those ages. You can choose whichever ages apply to you. My point is nobody should feel old, because we shouldn't be looking through the lenses of our younger selves. We should instead be looking through the lenses of our older selves, realising the time we have left and doing what that person would be proud of, regardless of if that's 40, 50, 60, 70 and so on.",

What good is a huge mansion if you're living in it alone? As you said, all superficial crap that does not bring happiness. After I have met my girlfriend, I have realized what I really want in life. I want to have a happy marriage, kids, a fulfilling job, a house in the suburbs...you know, what others might consider boring. But I think there is a time for partying and that time is over. I need to take responsibility for myself and for my family. Raising a family, and providing a happy life for my wife and kids is so much more meaningful than any luxury items. I still want to make a good living, but I am not willing to sacrifice my health and relationships for that anymore. It is all about balance and I think I have found what truly makes me happy. Being a good husband and father, an honest human being with values that go beyond superficial cravings for luxury. Wow, this is what growing up feels like right? haha"

After she finished venting, she used to disappear (without saying goodbye). She didn't even read my last few msgs and then she comes up again 2-3 days later saying 'Hey watsup, how you doing' and then repeat cycle.\n\nIt got really frustrating after a point and when she came back again after 3 days saying 'Hey watsup!' ignoring my last msgs I was like 'Nope I am done' and I told her that I get it she is busy, but she shouldn't ignore my last msgs and disappear randomly without saying goodbye only to appear a few days later. And that I don't wish to talk to her anymore. She said 'I am busy and I have work etc etc but if you don't wish to talk it's fine'\n\nI kind of felt bad but I am a guy who has low self-worth who is building his self-esteem little by little and starting to establish what is right or wrong for me and this was a huge step in this direction.

        "text": "**My interpretation**: A common and natural experience of life is to blame others, or even the world for its imperfections, and the inconveniences and pain it has caused you. As one gets older and matures, this blame tends to turn inward as we begin to focus on all the ways we have not lived up to our own standards, or the problems we have caused in the world. There is one final stage, however, that not everyone reaches, which is to to nonjudgmentally accept life as it is and to just focus finding ways to make things better.",

Then I looked into myself and found a fucking nest of problems. And for the past couple years blamed everything on myself. And I'm really hard on myself, to the point of hindering my ability of be happy. And I've begun to think, maybe I blame myself because it's easy. If I'm miserable and unhappy then if I fail at everything then it makes sense. I'm victimizing myself in my own brain and using that as some weird rational to not try at life. But that's wrong. I should treat myself as someone worthy  of respect. If I knew someone who treated a friend of mines the way I treat myself I would be fucking pissed."

One of the most upvoted posts there this month is literally Musk talking about how he doesn't like Chess and prefers more complex games. In what way is that something to be angry about?\n\nWhen you're caught up in all these online spaces it seems really important but when you stop viewing that type of content you very quickly realise it actually doesn't matter.\n\nYou only have so many hours in your life, why spend them getting angry at some guy who said stupid things?

It is a **step by step** **guide** for the **complete reboot**, to completely change your approach towards quitting porn and tackle PMO in the right manner.\n\nI've shared it in a few other subs, because I want to reach as many people as possible.\n\nIt is extremely long, but trust me, **it will change your whole perspective of quitting this addiction**. Just read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWritten by - TheUnderdog\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Porn Addiction is Being Severely Underestimated\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I know this?\n\nBecause most people in the community believe that in order to get rid of this addiction, all they have to do is keep trying over and over again, until eventually things will just 'click' and their brains will finally become rebooted.\n\nVery few are treating this as a true addiction. They just see it as a habit they want to break.\n\nThis is evidenced by the stubborness of many, relying purely on willpower for months, only to constantly reset their counters and beat themselves up for not making any progress.\n\nMost people don't realize how incredibly difficult it is to completely remove artificial stimulation (of any kind) for the rest of their lives. We're talking about years and years of brain conditioning here.\n\nWe're dealing with some powerful stuff here, but it is not treated seriously enough, probably because it's widely accepted by society and is not a substance like heroine or cocaine.\n\nI cringe when people relapse, reset their counters, and proclaim \"This is it, I've had enough, I'm going to do it this time\"...\n\nStop kidding yourself.\n\nThis is an addiction that has to be attacked from many different angles. You need a full arsenal of tools and strategies, as well as a proper mindset.\n\nWillpower alone won't do shit.\n\n**Abstinence is NOT Recovery**\n\nWhat people usually try to do is go as many days clean as they can.\n\nThat's all they do.\n\nThat's all their goal.\n\nThey achieve a certain amount of days, then for whatever reason they relapse, so they start over and repeat.\n\n**That is abstaining. That is not recovering.**\n\nIt is extremely common for people to achieve a certain milestone, such as 30, 90, or 100 days, relapse a few days later, and then find themselves unable to get momentum again. They go back to the beginning and they feel like they lost all their progress from their run.\n\nThere is a constant frustration for lack of progress. People are feeling overwhelmed and discouraged, trying the same thing over and over again without success.\n\nThis is because very few are addressing the real roots of their problems. Very few.\n\nEveryone is focused on how many days they have managed and if their symptoms are either present or gone. They judge their progress by measuring dick hardness, spontaneous erections and morning woods.\n\nThey are \"trying to quit porn\" so that they can \"get rid of their ED\".\n\nSo they abstain for as long as they can, hoping that this can cure their symptoms.\n\n**Completely wrong approach.**\n\nIf they don't see ED improvements, they get discouraged.\n\nIf they see ED improvements, then maybe a porn session or two won't hurt, right?\n\nIf there is no woman around, they justify watching a couple of times. After all, they are not having sex anytime soon, so whats the point?\n\nThey delay dating until their ED is cured or they have managed to go 100 days. But they never achieve this in the first place precisely because of this incorrect mentality.\n\nThe same applies to other symptoms such as social anxiety, energy levels, motivation, etc.\n\nThey try to quit porn, so that the symptoms can go away, and so they can finally live life.\n\nPeople are focusing on the wrong things.\n\nThey are not changing the way they think.\n\nThey are not changing the way they live.\n\nThey are not changing the way they view sex and women.\n\nThey are just trying not to masturbate, while everything else remains the same.\n\nThat, my friends, is abstinence, not recovery.\n\nThe Foundation of a Proper Reboot\n\n**Porn addiction is not the cause of your shitty life.**\n\nRead that again.\n\nOf course, it's difficult to improve your life when you're having intense porn sessions every single day that drain your energy and make you a zombie. But porn is not the reason your life sucks.\n\nPlease, this is very important to understand, you have to stop blaming porn for your problems.\n\nThis mentality of *life awaits me after recovery* is destructive.\n\nPorn is not the reason you're a procrastinator. Porn is not the reason you're depressed. Porn is not the reason you're lonely. Porn is not the reason you haven't been able to lose weight or gain muscle.\n\n**Porn is the symptom.**\n\nYou watch porn to escape reality. You watch porn to manage your emotions. You watch porn because you're bored, lonely, stressed, depressed, angry, isolated. You watch porn to feel good for a moment, to replace uncomfortable emotions and situations in your life.\n\nHere's how you get rid of this addiction:\n\nYou don't focus on quitting porn so you can finally get to live life after you're recovered.\n\nYou focus on learning how to live, how to manage your emotions, how to change the way you think and view the world.\n\nYou put all your energy into building the life you want.\n\nThis will naturally lead your mind away from porn.\n\nSuccess is not measured by how many clean days you've managed.\n\nIt's measured by how much your life has improved since you started rebooting.\n\nThis is what you need to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #1: Write a life vision for yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you envision your life a few weeks, months, or years from now?\n\nSpend a whole day (or week) thinking about this.\n\nDon't say *I don't know what to do with my life*.\n\nAre you telling me you have no clue what you want in any of the following areas: study, work, family, friends, hobbies, health, etc.?\n\nEven if you're not sure, you need to give your life some direction.\n\nThis is by far the most important part of recovering from pornography addiction.\n\nWrite like crazy. Write many pages if you want. Make the biggest post you've ever done in your journal talking about how you envision your future life.\n\nThis life vision will be the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThis is what you will focus on 100% from now on.\n\nClose your eyes. Visualize it. Write it down.\n\nIf you don't know what you want in life, then this is actually a more serious issue than porn addiction itself.\n\nLike I said, spend a whole week if you need to.\n\nBrainstorm.\n\nAsk for advice.\n\nTake a notebook and go to a park.\n\nInspire yourself.\n\nThis is the beginning of your recovery.\n\n**Take it seriously.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #2: Give urgency to your life vision\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, now you know what you want in life. Even if you're still unsure in some areas, such as not knowing what to study, that's ok. At least you can give your life some direction for the moment. This is very important. You need to give your life direction. You need to move towards something.\n\nHere's the problem. Many of us know what we want, but we keep delaying it. We're experts at delaying goals. We wait until New Years, or the beginning of a month, or until circumstances get better.\n\nSo this is what you're going to do now:\n\nYou're going to give urgency to your life vision.\n\nWrite down why you ABSOLUTELY MUST start working on it right now.\n\nMake another huge post or journal entry about it.\n\nLet's suppose you're 27 and you have no job, no car, still live with your parents, and spend most of the day playing video games. Why in the world would you wait more time before starting to do something about it? This is urgent bro. You're fucking 27!\n\nOr maybe you've never had a girlfriend in your life before. Well, what are you waiting for? Go buy some nice clothes, start going out more frequently, make mistakes, get rejected, ask women on dates. Start getting some experience NOW.\n\nYou have back pain? Start working on it. Don't wait. The more you wait the worse it gets. Start doing yoga or swimming. Move your hips and back constantly every day.\n\nWrite down reasons why you must start pursuing your life vision right now.\n\nYou have to stop living like this.\n\nThis is urgent.\n\nThis is high priority.\n\nWe must convince ourselves that change is imminent.\n\nIt's very important.\n\nA life vision is no good if you have no urgency.\n\nYou'll just keep delaying it. Waiting for circumstances to improve. Waiting for motivation to arrive. Waiting for the beginning of new year.\n\n**Create urgency.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #3: Develop an indestructible belief in yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the main reasons we quit goals is because deep inside we don't believe we're actually able to do it.\n\nWhen successful people like Arnold Schwarzenegger decide they want to achieve something, they become completely obsessed about it. They have an indestructible belief that they will achieve it.\n\nThey are not affected by circumstances. They create results in their head before they even get them.\n\nThis is what you have to do if you want to accomplish anything.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to learn how to play guitar. And you have the urgency to do it, because you know it takes time, so the sooner you start the better. You have to start now.\n\nHowever, after a few days of learning the basics, you start losing motivation and becoming discouraged. You realize that playing guitar is not easy at all. You feel overwhelmed by how much practice you need to put into it. You start doubting yourself and thinking \"There's no way I'll ever become a great guitar player and form my own band\". Friends tell you things like \"Dude, you should've started years ago. All great guitarists started when they were young\".\n\nSo you quit.\n\nThis is a result of a weak belief in yourself. You don't believe you have the potential to become a good guitarist. Which is obviously completely false. We as humans have unlimited potential.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger doesn't think like this.\n\nLook at what he said:\n\nHow many times have you heard 'You can't do this', 'You can't do that', 'It's never been done before'. I love it when someone says ' No one has ever done this before', because when I do it, that means I'm the first person that's ever done it!\n\nThis is how we should think when we set up to do anything in life.\n\nUncertainty is what kills people. Not knowing if they're able to achieve it.\n\nWe need to brainwash ourselves every day into believing that we WILL do it NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nAll of these steps are equally important.\n\nDo not skip them.\n\nThey are the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThey make rebooting so much easier. Your mind will be completely focused on what you want in life. You will be fixing the root of all your problems.\n\nThe secret of change is to focus all your energy not fighting the old, but on building the new.\n\nStop making posts complaining about your shitty life. Stop making posts saying how you're sick of being addicted to porn. Stop talking about porn altogether.\n\nInstead, transform your journal into a self-improvement journal, focused 100% on moving towards the life you want.\n\n**\"Forget\" about porn.**\n\nThis is basic rebooting stuff, yet many people are constantly breaking this rule. They write about porn cravings, morning woods, spontaneous erections, what day they're on, how much they struggled to abstain, how they can't wait to reach 90 days, etc.\n\nWhen you consistently focus 100% on building the life you want, your mind will naturally move away from porn. You will also lessen the void left by quitting porn, which is very real.\n\nMany people quit porn only to find themselves in this life emptiness that is very hard to handle. Then they go back to porn precisely because this void is too much for them.\n\nFocusing on your life vision is a superior rebooting approach.\n\nRelapses aren't that discouraging if you're actually improving your life. Ironically, you will notice that the more you focus on what you want, the less frequently you will relapse.\n\nIt's important that you think in terms of life vision and pursuing your dreams, not in terms of \"I have to get busy and fill my life with activities so that I don't watch porn\". This is something you're doing for yourself.\n\nStop ranting about porn.\n\n**This journey is about your LIFE.**\n\nFocus on that and the porn will go away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Managing Your Emotional Life\n\n# \n\nOk, let's keep going.\n\nPorn addiction is much more than just getting cravings and relapsing.\n\nOne of the reasons we become addicted is because of our inability to manage our emotional lives.\n\nYou have to remind yourself that quitting porn is about growing up and becoming a much more mature person.\n\nIt's much more than *I want to quit porn so I can cure ED and have plenty of sex with women!*.\n\nMuch more than that.\n\nWe've been using porn for years as a method of handling our emotions.\n\nWe need to stop hiding away from uncomfortable life situations. We need to stop using porn in order to escape from reality.\n\nWe must learn how to handle life and emotions without the need of porn.\n\nWe need to understand that one of the reasons we relapse is because we're pussies that can't handle negative emotions.\n\nWe use porn as medication. We use porn to hide away from life. We use porn to temporarily relief anxiety, stress, loneliness, boredom, anger, etc.\n\nReadjusting Your Sexual Expectations\n\nThis is by far one of the most difficult things to do.\n\nWhen you quit porn, you're not just saying good bye to artificial stimulation.\n\nYou're leaving behind the world of \"never ending flow of hot chicks with big tits and round asses\".\n\nReal life is nothing like that.\n\nWe've been spoiled by porn. We believe that we should be out there having lots of sex with different women. We believe that this is the key to happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThe problem is that it is incredibly difficult and unrealistic to \"fuck hot chicks on a regular basis\".\n\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with having that goal, but you have to be willing to take some MASSIVE action. You have to go through hundreds of rejections. You need to have a lot of balls. **You must do what 99.9% of men are incredibly afraid to do.**\n\nHow many people here are doing what it takes to have the kind of sexual life we all dream about?\n\nVery few, if any. We see these super hot chicks on tight dresses and we hope that maybe someday we might be able to have sex with them. We read books about seduction. We visit PUA forums. We watch videos on YouTube of guys approaching girls. We make theories and discuss them online.\n\nBut we aren't doing shit about it.\n\nIt's all just a dream. An idea we have in our minds. Something we hope someday we will do.\n\nHere's how most people get laid in real life:\n\nA guy meets a girl he finds attractive, so he asks her out. They get to know each other. Then they continue to go out and form some sort of relationship. Then after some months the relationship either becomes serious or falls apart.\n\nThat's the real world.\n\nYou have to accept that, unless you're willing to take massive action, you won't fuck anywhere near as many women as you expect to.\n\n**Accepting this is very difficult, but it is necessary.**\n\nWe need to learn how to live without this world of endless hot chicks, otherwise we'll become extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with real life, which is nothing like porn.\n\nAnyone here is more than capable of getting a girlfriend. But our girlfriends most likely won't look like pornstars, nor they will act like them.\n\nThere's a very high probability the sex won't be pornographic in nature. There's going to be a lot of sensuality, caressing, and also clumsiness. Some days your girl will look sexy, other days not so much. Some days she'll be in the mood, other days she won't. Some days you'll struggle to keep it hard, other days you'll cum too fast. She might be able to achieve orgasms, or she might not. You might do it every other day, or maybe only 3-4 times per month.\n\nRemember, pornstars are paid thousands of dollars to do what they're told and fulfill all your fantasies.\n\n**You must stop living in dream land.**\n\nI know this is very difficult to accept, but we have to give meaning to our lives outside fucking hot chicks.\n\nOur happiness cannot depend on that. Otherwise you'll keep coming back to porn every time you fail to get laid in real life. You will remain attached to \"sex with hot chicks\" for the rest of your life. You have to change the way you view sex and women, because I can assure you it has been completely distorted by porn.\n\nBy the way, I don't believe there's anything wrong about pursuing casual sex instead of a relationship, just make sure you keep both feet on the ground.\n\nI would also like to add that relationships are about sharing your life with another person. I know many people here want a girlfriend so that they can finally start getting laid, but relationships go much more deeper than that.\n\nIf you've never had a girlfriend before you'll know once you get one.\n\nThinking About Sex is USELESS\n\nWhat's the point of fantasizing?\n\nIt accomplishes nothing.\n\nIt slows down the reboot, increases the urge to masturbate, and reinforces neurological pathways related to porn.\n\nIt's a meaningless activity that should be eliminated.\n\nIt keeps your mind focused on sex, tits, asses, fucking, when it should be shifted towards other activities in life.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking about sex, you should mindfully and calmly redirect your attention to something else.\n\nYou want sex?\n\nGreat.\n\nThen do something to actually make it happen.\n\nFantasizing by itself serves no purpose at all.\n\nYou need to understand that if you want to abstain from orgasm and masturbation, you cannot be thinking about sex and women, because this will inevitably cause you to relapse. Trying to abstain while at the same time fantasizing or peeking at pictures of chicks will only lead to frustration.\n\nStay away from any kind of artificial stimulation. Don't take peeks. Don't browse pictures of girls online. Don't type pornstar names on Google image search. Don't read escort forums.\n\n**Do not arouse yourself.**\n\nBasically you have to adopt a philosophy of \"I'm either trying to get laid (approaching, texting girls, going out on dates, flirting with women, hanging out with friends, getting rejected) or doing something completely unrelated to sex (work, studying, exercise, fun, reading, playing an instrument, chores, housework, watching movies)\".\n\nThere is no grey area where you are alone thinking about sex or checking out girls online. This accomplishes nothing. It serves no real purpose. It will only increase urges, lead to relapse, and make you frustrated.\n\nAs soon as erotic thoughts pop up in your mind, you should calmly ignore them and refocus your attention to something else. You keep practicing this forever until you master it.\n\nYou have to attack this addiction right from the root. Trying to abstain from hardcore porn accomplishes nothing if you're still constantly fantasizing and peeking.\n\nIf you keep strengthening the mindset I talked about above, you will be making meaningful progress.\n\nThis used to be called \"Monk Mode\", but I don't like that name because it implies that you're going to become celibate.\n\nThis isn't about becoming celibate. This is about doing what it takes if you want to get laid, instead of wasting mental energy on sexual thoughts that will only improve the chances of relapsing.\n\nIf you ever want to achieve a long streak, you can't be checking out girls online, even if it's just some bikini pictures. You can't be fantasizing when you wake up in the morning. You can't be taking 5 second peeks at porn.\n\nAs soon as you do any of those things, this huge beast called porn addiction will take control over your prefrontal cortex and it's just a matter of time before you relapse.\n\nYou have to be extreme.\n\nBut don't worry, it's much easier than it sounds.\n\nIt's actually harder to stop yourself from relapsing once you're already thinking about sex, than it is to not think about sex in the first place.\n\nHow do you not think about sex?\n\nSimple.\n\n**Focus your mind 100% on your life vision.**\n\nEvery....single....day.\n\nDismissing erotic thoughts as soon as they arrive in your mind is the cornerstone for preventing relapses.\n\nThis is basic stuff guys.\n\nIt's Not Orgasm What You Crave\n\nMany people here believe that abstaining from orgasm is the most difficult part of rebooting.\n\n**WRONG.**\n\nWhen you get porn cravings, your brain is not asking for orgasm. As an addict, it is begging you for your hit. It misses the high, the tits, the asses, the novelty, the rush, the unrealistic sexual scenarios, the fantasies, the super hot chicks, the perfect camera shots, the feeling of letting go and indulging in pleasure, the fucking, the cumshots, the doggystyles, the boobs bouncing around, etc.\n\nIf lack of orgasm was the problem, then everyone would just fap without porn (or any other artificial stimulation). There would be no relapses and everyone would have 500+ day counters.\n\nThe urge to ejaculate only becomes a real problem once you start peeking, edging or fantasizing constantly. When you find yourself in a state of arousal then obviously you will want to cum.\n\nBut the initial urges are \"addiction urges\". They are mental. They are not a physical need for ejaculation.\n\nIf you feed these urges by peeking, even if it's just pictures of hot babes in bikini, then they will invade your mind and rob you of your ability to concentrate or remain calm. Eventually \"autopilot\" mode will be engaged and we all know what happens next.\n\n**You're not having urges to cum.**\n\n**You're having urges for a \"high\" and a \"rush\".**\n\nRemember that.\n\nThis is why porn urges don't go away when you get a girlfriend.\n\nIt is a drug, and you need to learn how to live without it, regardless of whether you have a girlfriend or not.\n\nWhen you abstain for several days or weeks, your sensitized pathways are anxiously waiting for any sexual cue, no matter how short or brief. This is why people mistakenly confuse real libido with porn cravings. They take a peek at porn after 15 days and they feel this intense rush and urge to cum, so they conclude that it is libido and that they must relieve pressure.\n\nThe problem was taking a peek in the first place. Had they just focused on more important things instead, they would've been able to finish the day clean without problem.\n\nIf you manage to completely abstain from fantasizing and checking out chicks online (in any form), then going a long time without orgasm won't be a problem.\n\nAnd don't even think about testing or caressing your dick.\n\n**Focus 100% on your life vision.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Counters vs Spreadsheets\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following advice is aimed particularly towards those members who are having trouble getting a good run. If you're already doing good, you can skip this section.\n\nOk, here's the thing:\n\nThere is a sickening obsession with long streaks on this forum.\n\nPeople like counters because supposedly they are helpful for tracking progress.\n\nWell, guess what? Spreadsheets do a much better job at that.\n\nThere's a reason why I'm so stubborn with this anti-counter thing.\n\nThey are dangerous, destructive, counterproductive.\n\nCounters reinforce the idea of being \"back to zero\" every time you relapse, making it way more justifiable to binge before starting over again. Not only that, but you completely lose track of how many times you're actually masturbating. They don't show the whole picture. There is absolutely no way to measure your progress at all. It's a never ending cycle of abstaining for a few days and then going back to zero.\n\nEvery time you reset your counter you become increasingly discouraged and unmotivated.\n\nThere's too much emphasis on what day you're on, no fap challenges (there are currently 7 no fap challenges running, it's ridiculous), 90 days, 100 days, etc.\n\nIf you're consistently unable to get past XX days and you're always in the low numbers, then your counter has lost its purpose.\n\nCounters are only good when you've managed a good run, because this gives you a sense of accomplishment and provides sufficient accountability to actually prevent relapses sometimes.\n\nNow, let's talk about spreadsheets:\n\n\\- They keep your addiction under control: By keeping track of how many times you're actually masturbating and having orgasms, you will be forced to keep it in the low numbers. If you relapse, the spreadsheet will discourage you to binge, especially when you're sharing it with the forum. A good rule of thumb is to try to keep your orgasm count to less than 5 per month.\n\n\\- They allow you to see the full picture. In gameover's words: \"You don't realise how you forget over a month how many times you actually masturbate, peek, pmo or orgasm until you have it in front of you. I thought i was well under 3-4 orgasms a month but I have been up around 6-7 and this month was no better.\" You'll be surprised at how many times you're actually fapping.\n\n\\- They completely eliminate the \"counting\" factor. All you have to do is keep it as clean as you can. Pretty cool eh? No more counting, no more 90 day goals, no more fap challenges. After all, we're trying to quit porn for life, not just 100 days or whatever.\n\n\\- They will never discourage you. If you do relapse, you input it on the spreadsheet and move on. You don't make a new thread called \"Relapsed again\" or \"Not making any progress\". Trust me, if you went from fapping 25 times per month to 2-3 times per month, you're making huge progress, even if your counter only says \"6 days\".\n\nSpreadsheets are NOT a taper off approach, of course. The goal should always be to never watch porn, to be as clean as you can, to take it one day at a time.\n\nTapering off, as in \"I watched porn 20 times last month, so I'll watch it 15 times this month\", will never work. You should never think like this. You should never give yourself the green light to PMO.\n\nIdeally, you should replace your counter with a spreadsheet and completely forget about what day you're on. Then, if you do manage to get on a good run, you can put your counter back up for accountability and motivational purposes.\n\nHowever, I understand many people here are in love with their counters.\n\nThey look pretty.\n\nThey are fancy.\n\nI get it, I get it.\n\nSo this is what I propose:\n\n(Once again, this ONLY applies to people who are struggling. If you're already on day 70 or whatever then don't change anything, but consider using a spreadsheet if you do end up relapsing.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, the typical rebooting advice of *Hey man, just do a 90 day reboot* is basically useless.\n\nThis is a very serious addiction and should be treated as such.\n\nWillpower alone won't do it.\n\nChange the way you live.\n\nChange the way you think.\n\nAnd please, stop making so many posts about porn, cravings, urges, relapsing, erections, 90 days, etc.\n\nInstead, **focus on the most important thing:**\n\n**Your life.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGotta clarify some things:\n\nI have never said that the reason we started watching porn was because of life problems. In fact, I would argue that is not the case for the majority of us.\n\nI didn't have any childhood issues or family problems when I was young. I just discovered porn on my own and liked it because it was very pleasurable. As kids and teenagers we are curious and horny.\n\nHowever, as years go by, we become dependent on it not only because of its extreme addictive nature and accessibility, but also because we start using it as a way to cope with life.\n\nThe reason we start using porn and the reason we continue to use porn once we're addicts aren't necessarily the same.\n\nI also didn't mean to say that all porn addicts have shitty lives. Actually by shitty all I mean is being dissatisfied in one way or another. Maybe you constantly put off your goals. Or maybe you waste a lot of time online and want to change that. That doesn't mean your life is shit. It just means it could be better.\n\nI am completely aware there are exceptions. There is a guy who told me he had no problems getting instant makeouts and fucking chicks the same day he meets them. There are others who actually have incredibly busy lives and only watch porn to get some pleasure and relax.\n\nWhatever your situation is, the main point of my post still stands. You should focus on moving towards what you want, instead of constantly complaining and wasting lots of energy on staying away from porn.\n\n**Concentrate on building the life you dream about and this will help you tremendously on your quest to overcome your addiction to porn.**",

        "text": "# About me:\n\nFor over two decades, I lived a life completely lacking discipline. I was the textbook definition of a mess:\n\n* I’d skip school for weeks or months at a time.\n* I’d spend entire nights binge-watching garbage on the internet, ignoring responsibilities.\n* My grades were abysmal, assignments were always overdue, and I had no focus or direction in life.\n* Add to that an addiction to fast food and endless social media scrolling, and you get a clear picture of someone stuck in a downward spiral.\n\nFast forward to today, and I’m a completely different person.\n\n* I’ve worked as a software engineer at Fortune 500 companies.\n* My academic performance improved drastically.\n* I consistently lift weights, read books, train in martial arts, and work on my business.\n\nHow did this transformation happen? It wasn’t overnight, and it wasn’t by simply “trying harder.”\n\nHere’s what worked for me:\n\n# 1. I Stopped Relying on Willpower\n\nFor years, I thought discipline was all about willpower. You just “decide” to do something, and then you do it—right? Wrong.\n\nI learned that willpower is like a battery—it runs out. Sure, you can force yourself to wake up early, work out, or eat clean for a few days, but eventually, your reserves will deplete, and you’ll revert back to old habits.\n\nHere’s an analogy that helped me understand this:\n\nImagine you’re thrown into a pit with 50 other people, all heavily armed with body armor, rifles, and night vision goggles. You, on the other hand, have nothing but a tiny knife. Your chances of surviving that fight are slim to none.\n\nRelying solely on willpower is like being that person in the pit—it’s an uphill battle you’re almost destined to lose.\n\nSo, I stopped relying on raw willpower and started equipping myself with better tools.\n\n# 2. I Built Systems\n\nThe most important shift I made was creating systems that removed the need for constant decision-making and made discipline automatic.\n\n# System 1: A Routine\n\nI started organizing my day into a routine. Every activity—working out, studying, eating, and even relaxing—had a specific time slot.\n\nWhy does this work?\n\n1. **It removes decision fatigue:** Constantly debating whether to go to the gym, study, or scroll on your phone is mentally exhausting. With a routine, there’s no debate—you just follow the plan.\n2. **It prepares your mind for what’s coming:** If you know you’re hitting the gym in 30 minutes, your brain starts to prepare for it. This makes transitioning into the activity much easier.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Remove barriers to action. For example, if I know I need to study after dinner, I set out my books, clean my desk, and know exactly what I need to tackle beforehand. This eliminates excuses and makes starting much easier.\n\n# System 2: A Rulebook\n\nI also created a personal \"code of conduct\"—rules I don’t break, no matter what. These are based on patterns I noticed in my life. For instance:\n\n* **Rule: No phone for the first 4 hours of the day**. In the past, I’d start my day by checking notifications and scrolling through social media. It seemed harmless but would ruin my focus and fill my mind with chaotic energy. Now, I avoid my phone in the morning, and my days are far more productive and peaceful.\n\nYou can create your own rules based on your triggers. For example, if hanging out with a certain friend always leads to bad habits, consider limiting that interaction. Write down your rules, and stick to them like your life depends on it—because in some ways, it does.\n\n# 3. I Switched from Instant to Delayed Gratification\n\nIn my undisciplined days, my life revolved around instant gratification:\n\n* Hours of video games.\n* Scrolling endlessly on Instagram.\n* Eating fast food and snacking whenever I felt like it.\n\nThese activities gave me a quick dopamine hit, but they came at a cost. I felt unmotivated, unproductive, and unhappy. Worse, I craved more of these fleeting pleasures just to feel a baseline level of satisfaction, which created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I discovered the power of delayed gratification:\n\n* The sense of accomplishment after a workout.\n* The satisfaction of completing a productive work session.\n* The happiness that comes from knowing I made progress toward my goals.\n\nUnlike instant gratification, delayed gratification doesn’t leave you drained or craving more—it leaves you fulfilled. Over time, I found myself craving these long-lasting rewards instead of the quick dopamine hits.\n\n# What I’ve Learned\n\nDiscipline isn’t about brute-forcing your way through life. It’s about creating an environment that supports your goals and adopting systems that make progress inevitable.\n\nIf you’re struggling with discipline, ask yourself:\n\n* Are you relying too much on willpower?\n* Do you have a routine or rules that guide your daily life?\n* Are you chasing fleeting pleasures or long-term fulfillment?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts—what strategies have worked for you in building discipline?",

This gets you there, you have belief and faith ad results that doing this gets me that., and it seeps into the subconcious.\n\nTop performers - athletes - talk about routines all the time - not only for practice and development but in pressure situations, the player just falls into, routine, this is my routine, and can get out of his head, away from the nerves by following the routine, becoming almost machine, robot like.  Why?  Because it works.\n\nI also think that, even though a routine is awesome… you may have to tweak it over time IF and WHEN somehow it begins to bore you or is no longer getting the result - as in, say , working out…you can follow the same routine or schedule but you maube have to make the weights heavier or more intense, sort of thing.   If you are sawing wood and getting results, great but after a while you need to sharpen the saw, or change the blade.\n\nAlso…\n\nAbout gratification, delaying it…\n\nWhen it comes to that, we tend to, in this world of instant on demand everything, build the habit of instant gratificatin and reward…we ingrain it, and often we do it with habits we now wish to cange and it feels so hard, as our brain is now like, wtf, where is it, I wnat it now like you been giving it to me for months and months…and so it feels like a mountain climb or a journey of 1000 miles to STOP that and go forward with delaying gratification.\n\nWhat helps me is to break it all down to ONE.\n\nI don’t have to delay forever or stop the bad habit forever.\n\nJust one time.\n\nOne day.\n\nOr one hour, at a time.\n\nMy thinking is I can do ONE of just about anything.\n\nSo this approach of “ONE” helps me get things done, as well as stop doing things for ONE hour or ONE day, etc.\n\nThe next day?\n\nIt’s still ONE.\n\nYesterday is over….tomorrow is a day away.\n\nNow (the new day) is just ONE again.\n\nIt works pretty good.\n\n\nThanks!"

        "text": "1. Your core friendship group will evolve over the coming years. Prioritise similarity of values over perceived social standing when it comes to selecting newcomers.\n2. Don’t feel insecure about peers who get off to a fast start, careerwise. We each work at our own pace, and you have plenty of time to figure out your true calling.\n3. If you want people to perceive you as mature; use your manners, treat others with respect and show plenty of humility.\n4. If you start saving and investing now, you’ll thank yourself later. At the same time, go easy on yourself if you don't manage to save much at all. There's plenty of time to play catch-up in your mid to late twenties and thirties.\n5. Find yourself a great mentor. Someone who holds themselves accountable for your progress, but takes no credit for your success.\n6. If you're having no luck with the ladies (or men, if you’re that way inclined), maybe it's just not your time yet. Overall, for men, dating becomes a lot easier in our later twenties/thirties.\n7. If you want to find your passion, get busy trying your hand at anything. Inspiration for passion often comes to those who are already busy working at something else.\n8. Don’t be in a rush to be taken seriously as an adult. By the time you are, you'll miss how much freedom from responsibility you had in your early twenties.\n\nPlease share any additional advice that comes to mind!",

        "text": "Dopamine detoxes can be difficult to convince yourself to try, but it’s much more simple than you may think. And trust me, it’s probably one of my favorite ways to bring clarity, peace, and wellbeing in my life. You’ll come out feeling like a new person.\n\nSo here’s what I recommend as a first detox: block out two days that are relatively stress free (could be a weekend, or even just a few days where work is light). Wake up without your phone, no TV, no music. Just listen to your thoughts, and be aware of your surroundings, and have a quiet morning.\n\nDuring the day, go about your day normally, but avoid overstimulation. Overstimulation comes in many forms: junk food, being in busy places, and social media. Be wary of what you eat and where you decide to spend your time. If you need help avoiding social media, get a tool that forces you to be mindful before you open your apps. I set up one that forces me to chat with an AI before unlocking (superhappy ai), which has helped a lot.\n\nMost importantly, avoiding overstimulation doesn’t mean being bored all day. A good first dopamine detox is one planned with relaxing self care activities like meditating, a nice walk with a good friend, reading, and more.\n\nAfter two days, your dopamine baseline should be reset! Feel free to carry this into the rest of your week, or don’t! Regardless, you should notice that you are more energized and happy, and best of all that you find joy out of the little things more often. By doing this detox, you’re investing in yourself. So please, take this as your sign to try it out :)",

        "text": "Pornography, Hollywood, and other forms of media have deluded men into false perceptions of women think and how attraction works.\n\nPorn is a falsified, artificially constructed representation of human sexuality, where attraction and arousal are instantaneous, easy and abundant without true effort.\n\nOn the other side, mainstream movies, i.e. romance porn, often portray unquestioned dedication as the ultimate way to woman’s heart. Unremarkable, piddling men will win a beautiful woman over through some grand act of devotion, reinforcing that idea that men can be mediocre and still attract beautiful women solely through sacrifice.\n\nLogically, we understand that movies and porn are fictional, but without experience or baseline knowledge, these misrepresentations become reality if reinforced early on.\n\nThese contradictory messages that women are owed to us (porn) and that they must be earned (mainstream media) have fucked up many men’s expectations and ability to handle rejection.\n\nMen who are inundated in this mindset and who have experienced a series of rejections from women, begin to view women as a monolithic group that have rejected them in totality, who are looking down them from a pedestal. Rather than understanding that romantic/sexual rejection is something that happens frequently and is not a source of shame.\n\nRed pillers, incels, and PUAs, are born out this. They blame women for being superficial or unattainable, they use band aids and tactics, rather than taking complete accountability an working to become an inherently attractive, interesting person. Even PUAs who achieve superficial success crumble when they encounter rejection, because their identity is largely predicated on acceptance from women.\n\nOur society worships at the altar of the Victim. It’s difficult to take complete ownership of your faults and failures, I certainly struggle with taking ownership at times.\n\nThis is not a pro-feminist post. This concept applies to both men and women. You and I completely responsible for our successes and failures, not anyone else.\n\nWomen are not owed to you, the same way your attraction owed to anyone else. Women did not have a secret global meeting and deem you unworthy. Everyone experiences rejection—those who imply that they don’t experience it are delusional or liars.\n\nYou are not victim. Your attractiveness or any other facet of your personality is not static. Your success solely depends on personal accountability and willingness to experience discomfort in order to grow.\n\nEdit: ‘Fault’ should be replaced with ‘Responsibility’, but the same concept applies\n\nEdit 2: This post got me permanently banned from the social skills sub 🤷🏻‍♂️ 🥂",

And most of all i've been working on myself aswell (sleeping longer and eating a bit better, drinking a lot more water and getting daily exercises aswell) and i feel so much better.

I put others over myself and thought that meant good things would happen to me, and well, that didn’t work out as I had expected. I did everything I was supposed to do and ended up sick, tired, and miserable because my underlying beliefs were that I needed to do / be something other than what I was in order to be worthy. \n\nI used to be a perfectionist. I used to be so tough on myself. I never believed I was worthy of good things. My outer life reflected that. I was addicted to adderall, nicotine, anorexic or stuck in disordered eating, over-caffeinated, sleep-deprived, constantly in toxic relationships, and in crippling debt. I thought poorly of myself based on old stories I clung onto. \n\nI’ve healed so much over the last few years but recently I realized that I never stopped to look around to where it got me. I never basked in the glory of this moment. And I still felt badly about myself. \n\nI decided to learn different healing modalities and just tune into myself daily. Instead of thinking of it as work, or something to change, I now know it’s something to do to understand my own beautiful uniqueness and capabilities. \n\nA few weeks ago I had a huge shift. I know it’s because of all of the things I’ve done over the last few years, and because I’ve finally accepted the fact that I am worthy and fully believe it. That feeling hasn’t wavered for weeks, and I don’t see it happening but maybe it will. I have tools to help. \n\nMy life today is beautiful and I feel very grateful. I’ve got everything I need and many things I want. I have a stable job, many things I’m passionate about, and am building a business in addition to my full-time job. \n\nTwo days ago, I had made a mistake. A simple one, but historically, no matter the size of the error, it would send me into a spiral: “I’m an idiot!” “What’s wrong with me?” And ruin my whole day about it. But two days ago, I literally sang, as if I was a kid, “I made a mistake, and that’s OK! Everyone makes mistakes!” Immediately after, I smiled so big because that was showing something deep down inside of me has shifted immensely. \n\nI just received some praise at work yesterday and I was fully open and knew I was deserving of it. It was a big moment as many important people were there to hear it, and I was singled out by name. I didn’t shy away or downplay it, I said thank you, proudly!\n\nThings are falling together because I finally know that I am worthy. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that really wonderful things can happen once you focus your energy on you. We can’t change what we did in the past. I spent so much years in shame over things I did when I didn’t know better. Beating yourself up today does nothing but ruin this moment. \n\nI wanted to share some affirmations as a practice if anyone is interested. They have really helped me on my journey. \n\nI am worthy.  \nMy past doesn’t define me.  \nEvery day I can choose a different way of showing up.  \nI deserve the life I want.  \n\n_\nTL;DR\n\naffirmations:  \n\nI am worthy.  \nMy past doesn’t define me.  \nEvery day I can choose a different way of showing up.  \nI deserve the life I want.\n\nEdit:\nThank you all for the support. I’m so glad so many of you resonate. I have a podcast called Everyday Perspectives where I unpack topics like this, shifting mindset from victim to co-creator with life.

        "text": "It starts with the small things. Events that seem insignificant at first glance are often the cause for drowning in gambling, substance abuse, or endless hours in front of screens.\n\nThe real pandemic of the 21st century was not COVID, but rapidly growing loneliness. Although we’re more connected than ever, nearly one in three Americans between 18 and 34 feels lonely every single day.\n\nBut the sinistery doesn’t stop here. Whether it’s the craving for meaningful relationships or the desire to realize one’s potential, once we’re caught in the guilt-addiction cycle, it’s hard to escape.\n\n**The road to addiction**  \nSignificant failures or traumas occur -> Negative beliefs take root: *I am unworthy* or *I am incapable of achieving XYZ* \\-> Guilt builds -> Dopamine temporarily masks the guilt -> Guilt intensifies -> More dopamine is needed to cope.\n\nThis is a sensitive topic, and I know some may feel defensive reading about it. But hear me out.\n\n**The only way out** is forgiveness and compassion. In about 50 summers, everything will be over. Many who count their last days right now wish they’d had the courage to pursue what truly mattered to them.\n\nSo here’s your Life Pro Tip: **Forgive yourself.** It’s the only way forward. **Unlearn the habit of comparing yourself to others** and instead measure your progress against who you were yesterday. During the **process of forgiving**, look for people who have what you desire. Learn from them - even if they’re your rivals. They have the potential to unveil your blindspots.\n\nDefine your goals in stages. Start small and keep escalating as you reach each milestone. Set a timeline and track measurable progress.

        "title": "I Started Focusing On Self Improvement 3.5 years ago - It Has Made A HUGE Difference, Here Are My Main Tips",
        "text": "I used to really struggle. I had self-esteem issues, organizational issues, would procrastinate and fail classes. However in the past few years, I started focusing on improving myself, and since then I've bought a house, significantly advanced my career (receiving top performance ratings and other accolades), and I've been able to pursue hobbies and grow my relationship with my girlfriend of 4 years (hopefully soon-to-be fiance). I think dating her made me realize that I had to straighten some of my own stuff out, and that's probably what initially set me off down this path of personal improvement.\n\nHere are a few key points I picked up along the way: \n\n**I needed to learn what my values are.** This is an exercise from the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey (BTW, this is my #1 Personal Development book ever, definitely read it or at least the spark notes if you haven't already). Imagine you die and you're attending your own funeral (either as a guest, a ghost, etc). Imagine various people from your life are speaking at your funeral - this might include your parents, spouse, coworkers, friends, etc... What do you want them to say about you? When I performed this exercise, I realized that I wanted people to remember me as loving and supportive, inspirational, hard-working to provide hope and alleviate suffering both in my local and global community, etc. I wrote these things down, and it eventually evolved into my Personal Mission Statement - a series of bullet points that summarize the values I want to embody in my daily life. I try to read this daily or at least a few times a week. It keeps me centered on what is truly valuable in my life so that I can make an effort to focus on those things rather than getting caught up in the distractions. This is a great first step - ideally, everything in your life should be aligned with your values. There's also a phrase I appreciate - Memento Mori - Latin for Remember Death. It sounds morbid, but if I think that these next 15 minutes could be the last 15 minutes I have, then it makes me reflect on what I'm currently doing and if it's how I want to spend the last few minutes I have - does it align with my Personal Mission Statement. (Is writing this Reddit post really how I want to spend my last 15 minutes??? Yes, yes it is. I'll come back to this later.)\n\n**I needed to learn self-awareness.** This is sooo important. If you are more self-aware, you'll be able to notice your emotions and actions, and if they are aligned with your values. If you notice that you are feeling depressed, stressed, angry, etc then you can do something about it. If I notice that I'm stressed out, then I might make adjustments to my plan. Maybe before I go interact with others, I try to spend an hour at home either taking a nap, or a bath, or exercising, or whatever to help calm my nerves. It's all about practice. To become more self-aware, you can try journaling to reflect on your day/life, you can try meditating, or you can even talk with someone you trust and reflect on your lives/actions. These things have all helped me out. It also takes practice/experimentation to understand what works well or doesn't work well to help you out when you're in these various states of mind. For example, if I'm feeling depressed, I've found that I shouldn't watch TV or play video games, but exercise, going outdoors, and spending time connecting with loved ones is very beneficial. \n\n**I needed to learn how to focus on what truly matters.** There are two parts to this: eliminating distractions, and then working on important, value-added activities. \n\n1. **Eliminating distractions**: Understanding my values has helped me to focus on the right stuff, and self-awareness has helped me to realize when I'm focused and if I'm not focused then what's causing the distraction. Growing up and all the way into my early 20's, I've always been very disorganized and distractable. However, I realized that if I can eliminate the distractions then it gives me space to freely work toward those things that align with my values. Eliminating distractions is a constant journey, and there are literally distractions in every part of my life. Here are some examples, and what I did about them. \n   1. Facebook/social media (yes, even Reddit) - I often found myself mindlessly scrolling through these online platforms, often for more than an hour each day. I deleted the apps from my phone. I then found myself going through my phone internet browser, so I even found how to block the website from my internet browser. \n   2. Emails - I realized my inbox would get filled with tons of stuff each day, most of which didn't add much/any value to my life. I unsubscribed from almost all emails, and when an email no longer needs my attention, then I archive it. \n   3. Physical clutter - Did you ever have an essay due tomorrow, and you'd find yourself cleaning the whole house to distract yourself? Maybe it's just me. Anyways, I have been on a journey of eliminating those little things that might distract me. Do I really need 30 shirts, so I spend 10 minutes sorting through them and figuring out the perfect outfit? Nooooooo. You can probably tell, this is basically minimalism. Minimalism can get some strong reactions from people, so I was hesitant to use that term, but yes I've adopted many minimalism philosophies/practices. \n2. **Completing value-added tasks**: I personally really benefit from checklists. It helps me to keep track of what is important and I find a lot of satisfaction in completing the things that are important and then crossing them off the list. I started using an app called Todoist on my phone and computer, and it's great. Because I'm so distractable, I have literally everything on that app haha it sounds a bit ridiculous, but it even includes things like brushing teeth and making the bed. Also, I believe in the 80/20 rule - spend 20% of the effort to get 80% of the impact, you can always go back later and put in more effort if you get some time. But it's important to keep moving onto the next goals. For example, when lifting weights, I focus on the big 3: squats, deadlifts, and bench press. If I only have 30 minutes to work out, I want to make sure I get the biggest bang for my buck. There are three general categories of tasks to focus on. \n   1. Sustainment tasks: these are things like exercising, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, practicing good hygiene, and caring for loved ones. These are crucial, because if they get neglected, then eventually I will find myself in a situation where I am not free to work toward my dreams. For example, if I neglect my health, then I will get sick which will drain me of energy and money - two essential resources.\n   2. Tasks that eliminate distractions and streamline the sustainment tasks: these are tasks like purging old items, clearing your calendar, etc. For example, I like to meal prep. It saves time and money and ensures I have a healthy diet. I also use Instacart, to help save even more time.\n   3. Tasks that move you forward toward your vision: these are tasks that align with a dream or vision that you have. Maybe you want to start up a non-profit, so taking steps toward that. Or maybe you want to start a family, so taking steps toward that. Taking steps toward owning a home.\n\n**I needed to practice financial responsibility.** Fortunately, I've always naturally been a frugal man, so this hasn't been as big of an issue for me as it is for some people. Financial freedom is truly invaluable, it provides opportunities to expand your knowledge and work freely toward those value-added tasks mentioned above. If I relied on the next paycheck to get through the next few weeks, then that gives my boss power over me - he can say I have to work 90 hours next week and not get paid for that overtime, and I don't have as much freedom to tell him to eff off. I have experienced some very tight financial circumstances, and it can be extremely stressful. This isn't meant to be a guide on how to save money and grow wealth. I definitely suggest investing some time and energy into learning about finances if you haven't already.\n\n**I had to learn how to effectively communicate.** I've never been a person to openly talk about feelings or be vulnerable. I've also had difficulty asking for the things I want/need. I've gotten lots of practice through dating my girlfriend as well as my work. These are two separate areas where I get to train and refine my communication skills daily. Being a more effective communicator has allowed me to connect with people on a more personal level, and it helps me to get the weight off my shoulders and get the things I need to thrive. \n\n**Summary**:\n\nSpend time investing in yourself: grow your knowledge, wealth, and freedom. Spend time working toward goals that bring you joy and align with your values and vision for how you want to live your life. To be honest, writing up a long Reddit post isn't my favorite thing to do. But I deeply enjoy helping people, and these online Reddit communities helped me get going on this journey many years ago, so I'm paying it forward. Don't get hyper-focused on self-improvement, doing so can lead to being overly self-critical. Just have fun with it, and keep doing tasks that make your life easier, happier, and bring you more in line with your dreams. I hope this helps somebody. If you have questions/suggestions, please stick it down in the comments or feel free to message me. Have a great day, friends!",

        "text": "Don’t think about you situation too much, you’ll end up creating a problem that wasn’t even there to begin with. \n\nThe mind is a very powerful tool. Everything begins and ends in your mind. What you give power to, has power over you, if you allow it. In retrospect, if you keep on thinking about a certain negative thing over and over again, it will control you mind, so far as it will be the first thing you’ll think of when you wake up and the last thing before you sleep. Initially, it will completely take over 100% of your mind, a task that’s very hard to get rid of. \n\nThe best way to live life is to stop thinking about the worst. Instead, think positively in a way that whatever happens happens and you’ll learn from it, no matter the situation. A massive cause for people to panic, worry and become scared is overthinking. We are all guilty of this. Overthinking, quite frankly, ruins you. It will drain everything out of you, until there’s nothing else left. Overthinking ruins the situation, twists and swirls everything around, makes you constantly worry in fear and makes everything worse, when in reality, there is no need for it. \n\nUnderstandably, saying “turn your negative thoughts into positive” isn’t a walk in the park and doesn’t just happen within thin air. It takes guts, time, patience and all your emotions to get through the darkest of days. As I said, time is crucial. It doesn’t take a day, a week or even a month to get rid of negative thoughts inside of your head, it may take a few years, to ensure you’re ready to let go of all the pain and torment your mind has gone through. But, believe you me, once you realise you’re ready and you start to brighten up day by day, it will be the best feeling ever. :) \n\nYou don’t get the same day twice in life. Today’s date is September the 22nd 2020. Just a reminder, you’re never going to see this day again, make the most of it!\n\nEdit: PM’s are open for support. :)",

                "body": "Ruminating is a killer. Therapy taught me some valuable tools to start to turn it around.\n\n- If you are stuck on a negative loop, instead of trying in vain to distract yourself, give the thoughts your full attention. But not all day long. Set a time. So at 6pm, I'd sit down without any distractions and think the thoughts. And you know what? It gets so boring really fast. Once you let your mind focus on them, it actually becomes easier to move on. \n\n- Don't just try to replace negative thoughts with overly positive thoughts that you don't actually believe. Instead, come up with some true, specific thoughts to counter the negative thoughts. So if you think \"no one likes me\" and you play out rejection scenarios in your head (guilty), don't replace that with \"people like me\" but instead have specific, true examples. \"My parents love and are proud of me\" or \"My friends Tom enjoys my company\" or \"my coworkers inquire about my life because they are interested in me as a person.\" Write them down. Carry them around. Do this with each thought.\n\n- Change the situations that usually lead to negative thoughts. I used to ruminate in bed a lot. So I had to learn to never lay in my bed if I wasn't sleeping. No lying awake in the morning. If I couldn't fall asleep at night, I would get up until I was tired then try again. \n\nEveryone is different, but Hopefully these tips might help someone. <3"

(EDIT). \n\nIf you can pull or are pulling off all of these each day and you're stressed, understand you're the 1% and that you're truly doing this to yourself. \n\nI promise you most of your boomer bosses bought a home when it was cheaper, have a family or a spouse to split errands with (or probably a stay at home partner who cooks their meals, does the laundry, and cleans). They almost never exercise, or engage in developmental hobbies, and usually spend most of their evening with their loved ones or in front of the TV/PC. \n\nIf you're wondering why others or your co-workers are so happy and care-free, odds are they don't hold these high expectations over themselves or have slowly let them go over time. \n\nBe easy on yourself. This is something I needed to tell myself, and I'm sure someone out there needs to hear it as well.\n\n\nEDIT: I had previously changed my answer from \"They Don't\" to \"Most Don't\" but for some reason it didn't save last night. And to those saying it's possible: I fully know it's possible, I've been doing it for the past 5 years, but what has developed in my experience is a sense of perfectionism and guilt for having missed or not being able to do one of these task; this was a message for those who are being hard on themselves when they feel as if others have it easier (because they usually do).",

I’ve been trying for quite a long time to do this. There has been some improvement in the course of a few years."

        "text": "This is an update post one the one I made two months ago. TLDR: I've (24F) consistently had bad mental health episodes for the last 8 years of my life. Today marks my one year milestone of a year without a bad episode. I was worried I wouldn't make it but I did!\n\nThis time last year I was a totally different person. Single, unemployed, lonely, and depressed. I was in the middle of a particularly bad mental health episode and I decided I couldn't go on this way. So I changed my medication, went to therapy and self help groups and things started looking up. \n\nI got a job in march last year, I also got a boyfriend in march, we'll be coming up to a year in a month's time. Because of work I started making more friends. I also found a new direction to take my life.\n\nI graduated university 3 years ago, but I'm not sure what I want to do with my degree. But actually, I've decided to go in a completely different direction and try to become a tattoo artist. My new years resolution has been to put my art out into the world. And I've started my art Instagram and I've started building a portfolio to help me get an apprenticeship after lockdown. It's something I'm really excited to do. I hope I can do it.\n\nTo celebrate my milestone I took 2 weeks off work. In the time, I did a massive declutter of my room, I made homemade cheese, I cut and dyed my own hair. And I made myself a cake. I mentioned in my last post that a while ago I found a Tumblr post. In this post the girl said something along the lines of \"one day everything will be ok, and on that's day I'll make cherry pie\". And then a few years later she posted a photo of a cherry pie. Well this is that for me. One day everything will be ok, and on that day, I'll make cake. Well today is that day! I made myself a dulce de leche cake and it was amazing!! \n\nI've still got ways to go for sure. I'm still working on becoming a healthy weight. I kinda stopped trying to do that around Xmas. I'm still working on my portfolio. To be honest, although I haven't suffered with SAD as bad as I usually do. I've definitely felt lower. Like I've been hibernating. My motivation for my portfolio and weight loss stopped. But now things are getting lighter and I have this boost from my milestone, I'm going to kick myself back into gear. Brush off the cobwebs and wake up a bit. \n\nIf anyone has any advice for helping me wake up and come out of hibernation I'd really appreciate it. I need a good kick up the bum. \n\nThe last thing I have left to do, once I get paid this month, I'll be buying my friends, family and boyfriend small gifts to say thank you for their support during this year. I definitely couldn't have done this alone. No man is an island. \n\nHere's hoping this year will be as good as the last, I hope to see you back here in 2 years! Thank you for taking the time to ready my long-ass post, I appreciate it. \n\nTLDR: I made it one year without a bad mental health episode, it's the best I've ever done. I made myself a cake to celebrate.",

        "text": "Self critical thoughts. Guilty thoughts. Thoughts about what I should have done. Fearful thoughts about what others think. \n\nHow dark are the thoughts that follow you around each day? Mine get pretty dark.\n\nThis is haunting if we let ourselves identify with them. We listen to the fears of inadequacy just because they won’t shut up. We believe we really are failures because it’s all we can think about - no matter how much self improvement we read. If it was possible for us to be fixed then why do we still feel so broken?\n\nStop. We are not our thoughts. I need you to see the bigger picture of who you are - not thoughts but actions. I bet you take great care of your pets even when you feel horrible. I bet you have tried self care like yoga and meditation and journaling so you can feel better. I bet you try to help out your friends and family in little ways. Your actions paint a different picture of you than your thoughts. I can’t stop you from judging yourself, but I can ask you to at least consider all the evidence.\n\nI know you feel a lot of pain. I know the thoughts are dark and you wish they would stop. But don’t you dare believe that those thoughts define who you are. You never chose those thoughts. You didn’t ask to feel the pain and negativity. The real you is the one who decided what actions you wanted to take. Do not base your identity and self image on thoughts you don’t even want in your head. Look at the actions you take. Look at the work you put in, especially on the days when you don’t feel like it. That’s who you are. \n\nYou are the captain of a ship in turbulent water. You are steering your life every day in a storm of thoughts that you can’t control. Here’s the thing. It’s not your fault that this storm is here. Don’t hate yourself because the wind is howling and the ship is rocking. You are not the storm, you just need to steer the ship. It’s easy to think that other people share the thoughts you do. That they think about you as negatively as you do, but that’s not true. They don’t see the storm you feel inside, they just see you steering the ship. They see your actions. They see you trying to help others, they see the work you do, the work you put in, the words you say. The actions are who you choose to be, and the version of you that the world sees. Not your thoughts.\n\nMaybe your actions haven’t been what you wanted lately. Mine haven’t either. That’s hard because it can create even more dark thoughts. But that doesn’t mean you can’t choose different actions today. Your actions today define who you are. Not your actions yesterday, and sure as hell not your negative thoughts. So imagine all your thoughts as waves in the ocean passing through. They come and go, some are painful, but they never last. They are not you. You are not your thoughts. You are your actions, and you can choose your actions.\n\nWho will you choose to be today?\n\n**Further reading:** If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend *Awareness by Anthony de Mello*. When we identify with every thought in our head it’s like walking a tightrope during an earthquake. Negative thoughts pull us in so many directions and life is anything but peaceful or calm. This book is incredible for helping you become aware of your thoughts and step back from the ones that aren’t helpful. His advice helped me catch negative thought loops faster and step out of them. They still come up, but they only get 5 minutes steering the ship before I kick them out, not 5 hours.",

And if you're personally experiencing these problems, I understand the struggle. I know it's not as simple as just \"relax and don't think so much!\"\r\n\r\nSo how DO you take that comfort that you feel with your close friends and carry it over into all your other social interactions?\r\n\r\nIt's about letting go.\r\n\r\nYou have to let go of the need to be perfect. You have to remove the pressure that you put on yourself. These are limitations that you've put on yourself; and only YOU can remove them. \r\n\r\nWhen you can do this, and when you can treat the person you're talking to as if they were a friend, they will subconsciously receive signals that they are allowed to feel comfortable as well!\r\n\r\nIt's magic. You will feel like you're doing nothing at all, and yet get compliments from people that you are \"so easy to talk to.\" \r\n\r\nThe journey to becoming the most confident version of yourself is not always comfortable… but it's worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you need help with this, let's have a conversation.

        "text": "Most people assume that ‘having your shit together’ means you’re successful in your career or that you make a lot of money. \n\nIt simply means that you are in control of your life—you take active ownership of your living environment, your health, your ambitions, and your finances. You put in work maintaining certain aspects of your life, which allow you to thrive and maintain your sense of independence.\n\nHaving your life in order indicates that you not only can take care of yourself, but you are able to contribute to a relationship and not be a burden. This is why responsibility is sexy—men and women are biologically driven to seek partners that not only produce healthy children, but can help provide for and raise their children effectively.\n\nNo matter how physically attractive someone is, if their life is in disarray—their place is a mess, they have toxic personal relationships, they have no solid goals, etc.—it is a massive turn off. If someone can’t handle their own lives, how can they be reliable in a relationship.\n\nFeeling safe emotionally is particularly important for women. Personal Instability and lack of reliability is a significant source of emotional distress.\n\nIt’s ultimately up to you how you get your shit together, but here are some general rules:\n\n- Keep your living environment clean and organized. This is paramount. A simple act such as making your bed every morning, doing dishes, making sure your bathroom isn’t nasty and stays fresh. When you bring someone over and your living environment is chaotic, they will feel uneasy and lost attraction.\n\n- Be a person of action, rather than words. Instead of telling someone you’re going to do something, take actionable steps towards your goals. If you say you’re going to do something, follow through.\n\n- Stay on top of your finances. This doesn’t mean you have to be wealthy, but having an understanding of your expenses and savings. Having a basic understanding and knowledge of investing (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, dividends) is necessary to build wealth for yourself.\n\n- Most importantly, maintaining your health. This is not about maintaining your physical appearance(although it’s a positive bonus), but rather making sure your physical and mental well being are maintained. This isn’t always easy—eating well, getting proper sleep, limiting caffeine and alcohol—can be sacrificed for easier options that provide more monetary pleasure.  These seemingly small decisions will have a massive impact on your mental health and quality of life",

        "text": "I am so much excited on this journey to self love! If anyone else is experiencing something similar, let me know how it was for you!\n\nUpdate: \nWow, so many responses. I am happy to see I am not alone on this journey - thank you for sharing your experience to all of you! \n\nI’ve seen many questions on how I did it, so I will try to sum it up here. I am just starting this journey, but I can share what has worked for me so far. \n\nFirst thing I started doing is going to therapy - it brought me on the right path. Then step by step I started learning what it means to feel. In the past I simply did not allow myself to feel certain emotions, because I was afraid it would affect other people’s perception of me. So I used to be this calm and reserved person all the time, and I tried to do things constantly, so I could not stop and think and be sad for a second. I was too afraid. This was not real me. \n\nReal me can feel and is okay with any emotion. Real me can speak up when someone passes the limits of my personal boundaries. Real me can be angry. Real me can leave the work earlier because I want to, and go buy an ice cream or go to an exhibition and NOT feel guilty about it. Because what’s the worst thing that will happen? We only got one life. \n\nSo second thing I did is acceptance of my emotions. Third thing is putting my needs and desires first and believing that I don’t owe anything to anyone. It is my life and my choice. And then, once I got rid of some of the psychological boundaries I remembered what I’ve always enjoyed and I started photography, I bought my first camera. \n\nI also try to slow down and look into the window, look at my hands and notice how beautiful they are, smile to myself in the mirror. \n\nOne technique that helped me a lot is setting a timer for every two hours every day, and when I hear this sound, no matter where I am and what I do, I ask myself “How do I feel? Is this what I want to do right now?”. Sometimes it catches me so unawares that I stop doing what I was doing, and do something I really want to do, or just slow down. \n\nI hope you can relate to at least some of it, and thank you again for so many responses. I am beyond happy to see that I am not alone ❤️",

It’s more complex than that for most, even if it’s clearly the thing that they should not be worrying about. \n\nIn reality, it’s a concept of confidence in oneself that needs encouragement.

I was at a meet up with the bros when she asked me to come to town to see her to bar hop and club in Halloween costumes. The bros said 100% go, so I grabbed a costume and headed out.  \n\nTwenty minutes in, she said her and her friends are using the restroom. 10 minutes later I asked her if she has been to a certain bar and got left on read. After ten minutes, I assumed I was ditched so I changed out of my costume and went to my favorite bars in the area because I was already there.  \n\nI ate good food, had some good beer, played pool, talked to some good people, and played darts. It was a good time! I did end up blocking her and considered saying something to her, but thought \"If you don't respect yourself, why should anyone else?\" And having me drive an hour to ditch me in 20 minutes meant she didn't deserve more of my time.  \n\nI used to put up with behavior like this and would forgive them, I was quite the pushover and I have since worked on this extensively. Did things go how they were supposed to? No, but I proved to myself that I respect myself a lot and that's a win in itself.\n\nMake the most out of the bad and never let somebody's shitty behavior towards you ruin your day.",

Today marks the third straight day in a row where I have brushed my teeth and I couldn't be more proud of myself!! There is only room for growth and I have nowhere to go but up. Cant wait to tackle 2020!",

And there is **SO MUCH** you can control, if you apply the proper discipline:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) **Fitness** \\- Eat clean and train mean. Work on your physical body and not only will you look better, you will feel better and feel more confident\n\n2) **Education** \\- It doesn't have to be just college. Keep learning. Read as much as possible. You can learn an entire life's worth of lessons (from numerous biographies) in a span of a few hours. That's a bargain. Take it and apply it.\n\n3) **Hobbies** \\- Can really be anything honestly. Find what you like and invest in it! You like to cook? Learn to cook better. Passionate about rock climbing. Then keep rock climbing! Are you a gamer? Game with others and build relationships as a result. It can be anything honestly. The important thing here is that you enjoy what you do because a true passion is super interesting no matter what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe your biggest advocate. Invest in yourself. I promise you that if you do the above, especially #1 and #2, you won't have to chase as much. People will chase you.\n\nStay hungry. Stay focused. You got this.",

When improving ourselves we try to increase our \"value\" in order to people outside to appreciate us somehow and try to be with us. There is something deeply flawed in this reasoning. We are not commodities and reading books or improving our looks for the ultimate goal of being connected to the rest of society is unfair and shalllow (not saying it is you.)\n\nI believe we should do things because we like them or because we consider valuable, end of the conversation.

        "text": "Hey r/selfimprovement,\n\nI wanted to address an issue on this subreddit that seems to be affecting a lot of young people out there - attaching one's self-worth to whether or not you have a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc or have had sex.\n\nSociety often puts an immense amount of pressure on people to achieve these milestones as a measure of their worth, but it's essential to understand that your self-worth is about so much more than your relationship status or sexual history.\n\n1. **You are a complete person on your own:** It's essential to remember that you are a whole, unique, and valuable individual, regardless of whether you have a partner or not. Your worth is not determined by someone else's presence in your life. Embrace your individuality and work on building a strong, independent identity.\n2. **Focus on personal growth:** Instead of focusing on finding a partner or engaging in sexual activities, shift your focus to personal growth. Invest time in your education, career, hobbies, and personal interests. Work on becoming the best version of yourself, and you'll naturally attract people who appreciate you for who you are.\n3. **Develop healthy relationships:** Building and maintaining strong friendships is crucial for a fulfilling life. Establish meaningful connections with people who share your values and support your growth. Genuine friendships can provide emotional support and bring happiness to your life, regardless of your relationship status.\n4. **Mental and emotional well-being:** Attaching your self-worth to relationships and sex can lead to anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem. It's essential to recognize that your mental and emotional well-being is a priority. Practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if needed.\n5. **Understand that relationships are not a solution:** It's a common misconception that having a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc or engaging in sexual activities will solve your problems or make you happy. However, relationships come with their own challenges, and it's crucial to recognize that happiness comes from within.\n6. **Patience and timing:** It's important to understand that everyone's journey is different. You may find a partner or engage in sexual activities at a different time than your peers, and that's okay. Life isn't a race, and you should focus on building a life you're proud of, rather than comparing yourself to others.\n7. **Embrace vulnerability and emotional intelligence:** One of the most attractive qualities a person can possess is emotional intelligence. Learn to express your emotions, be empathetic, and communicate effectively. Being vulnerable and emotionally intelligent will lead to deeper, more meaningful connections with others.\n\nIn conclusion, remember that your self-worth is about so much more than your relationship status or sexual history. Focus on personal growth, establish healthy relationships, and prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. By doing so, you'll create a fulfilling life and attract the right people into it.",

        "text": "This week I signed up to a Gym membership, and Counselling Therapy sessions for the first time in my life. \"I don't need excersize\" or \"I don't need counselling\" were words I repeated to myself every day of my life. But everything changed recently and I've started to care about wellbeing. The truth is, I still feel the same about myself. No matter how hard I try, I can't \"Love myself\". I just had to learn to love the person I want to become. I'd imagine a future-me where I was proud of myself, and I kept that image in my head. I'm so in love with future-me that I was prepared to do anything to become that person.\n\nI'm no expert, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but if you're feeling stuck like I was, maybe lying to yourself that you love yourself isn't the way to go. Maybe it's realizing you CAN love yourself in the near future, and using that to motivate yourself.",

It has boosted our egos in negative ways where we think the world is watching us. In the process, we have become slaves to people's thoughts and perceptions. \n\nIf that is something you struggle with, I encourage you to try this experiment - Get off social media for 1 month and don't announce that you are doing so. Just quietly log off or don't post anything. And don't check anything while you do so.\n\nThis might be uncomfortable at first as we are so wired to our phones. And it will only get worse. I bet a large number of you will find that very few, if any at all, will actually notice that you've been inactive. This has happened to me and to a large number of people and has served as a humbling experience.\n\n**Why do I suggest you try this? Well, if you are a slave to what people think, this can be a very liberating exercise in realizing that LITERALLY NO ONE CARES OR IS THINKING OF YOU. So what you post and what you do should not be dependent so much on others think. Just do you.**\n\nIf you are willing to embrace the discomfort, I think you will come out of it more humbled with a healthier self-perception and self-esteem in the process.",

        "text": "\"Hey, the general manager wants to see you in his office'\" is rarely something that a guy on the bottom of the totem pole wants to hear.  This is what was told to me when I was a lot porter at the Porsche dealership that I worked at.  Basically I washed the cars, swept the floor, took out the trash, and just made sure the dealership looked good.  I had no seniority or subordinates and was definitely the lowest paid.\n\nWhen dusting off the showroom cars, where insurance alone is 2-months pay for me, I bumped into a gentleman that used to work there and we struck up a conversation.  He asked what I did and I said  \"ahhh, I'm just a lot porter here. It's a good job for a college kid, but nothing too flashy.\"  We parted ways and I continued on with my day.  A few hours late I'm being summoned to the general managers office.\n\nHe sat me down and said that he just got done talking to a good friend of his, the same man I conversed with earlier.  Then he said \"You know, I heard something very alarming from him. He told me that you said you were 'just a lot porter.' Is that true?\"  I told him yes.  He then told me something that I have never forgotten.  He said \"Look, you're not 'just' anything.  You're a lot porter, not just, not only, you're a lot porter and you're just as, if not more, valuable to this team than the guys selling the cars. I see you every day making sure this place looks sharp, and without that, these sales guys don't sell anything. If the cars are dusty, or theres dirt on the floor, they are going somewhere else. And we all know that they are going to be dusting the cars.  You're not 'just' a lot porter, remember that.\"\n\nI've never forgotten that, and to this day I've caught others with the similar thought.  So, if you are using the word \"just\" in front of your job description, I'd encourage you to drop that part.  You're needed in your position, and not \"just\" anything.  If your position was that irrelevant it would most likely be automated.\n\nAll this said, there's something to be said about toxic environments, being happy in a position, morale, or the many other reasons why you're dissatisfied with your position.  Those are all important topics, but just for your own sake, don't' use \"just\" anymore, and for those who are in leadership positions, don't use it to describe your subordinate positions either.\n\nI hope this serves you and those you work for, alongside, and over.  It has served me many times over and has brightened both my self-pride and worth as well as those whom I have had the pleasure to lead.",

Self-care should not be something we resort to because we are so absolutely exhausted that we need some reprieve from our own relentless internal pressure.\n\nTrue self-care is not salt baths and chocolate cake, it is making the choice to build a life you don’t need to regularly escape from.\n\nAnd that often takes doing the thing you least want to do.\n\nIt often means looking your failures and disappointments square in the eye and re-strategizing. It is not satiating your immediate desires. It is letting go. It is choosing new. It is disappointing some people. It is making sacrifices for others. It is living a way that other people won’t, so maybe you can live in a way that other people can’t.\n\nIf you find yourself having to regularly indulge in consumer self-care, it’s because you are disconnected from actual self-care, which has very little to do with “treating yourself” and a whole lot do with parenting yourself and making choices for your long-term wellness.\n\nIt means being the hero of your life, not the victim. It means rewiring what you have until your everyday life isn’t something you need therapy to recover from. It is no longer choosing a life that looks good over a life that feels good. It is giving the hell up on some goals so you can care about others. It is being honest even if that means you aren’t universally liked. It is meeting your own needs so you aren’t anxious and dependent on other people.\n\nIt is becoming the person you know you want and are meant to be. Someone who knows that salt baths and chocolate cake are ways to enjoy life – not escape from it.",

If you are like me, chances are that ,unless it was humorous or extreme, you may have a hard time remembering a lot of these situations about other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow flip that thinking to yourself.  If you can't remember what they did.  They don't remember what you did.  If you beat yourself up for your past mistakes just remember: you are the only one thinking about it so cut yourself some slack. You're human and making mistakes is part of this thing called life.  You don't have to be embarrassed about times you fell short.  Take something away from those instances. Learn from them and move forward. You are still alive, act like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this helps someone.",

        "text": "Introverts typically prefer interacting with smaller numbers of people rather than large groups, take more time to open up to strangers, and don’t mind being alone as much.\n\nAlthough it sounds contradictory, introverts can be outgoing. Being outgoing means being friendly, initiating an interaction with someone in a positive manner, a trait not solely reserved for extroverts. Although it may not come as naturally and requires more work to get into that mindset, an introvert can be just as charming when interacting with a stranger out in public. As mentioned previously, being introverted often means being more at ease being alone, which is powerful and is the biggest deterrent against neediness.\n\nOn the other hand, being shy is the biggest impediment to being good with women, or with people in general. It doesn’t matter if you are handsome, jacked, wearing amazing clothes. If you cannot hold a conversation,or are constantly feeling insecure, you don’t have a chance out there.Being shy means being closed off, emotionally defensive, self-conscious, and fearful of the opinions of others. It is rooted in the fear of rejection.\n\nThere is no magic solution to prevent shyness and build self-confidence. It is different for everyone. Therapy, group activities, saying hello (not creepily) to strangers when out, working out are actions to consider.\n\nHowever, the most important thing to remember is that being shy is not a static quality that only introverts exhibit. It may require more initial discomfort,but introverts are just as capable of being attractive and socially competent as an extrovert.",

At all.\n\nSleep has been scientifically proven to boost pretty much everything - mental clarity, health, recovery, focus, mood and so forth.\n\nSpeaking as an older person now, when I don't get 7-8 hours of sleep, I'm distracted, slightly cranky, and unfocused for large parts of the day. And the lack of sleep always catches me in the rear when I crash at home or on the weekend.\n\nI don't know your particular situation. Maybe some of you really are in a position where you can't get adequate sleep. I understand.\n\nBut for the vast majority of us, how many of you lack a sleeping schedule and just binge Youtube videos in bed for hours on end? \n\nPlease don't do this to yourself. Set a time to sleep and get 7-8 hours of rest.\n\nYou will thank yourself everyday.",

We will always find evidence to confirm our beliefs, so which ones are you focusing on? \n\nMost of my life focused on what had gone wrong. It focused on the story that bad things happened to me. And when I started to look for the good, started to look around at people who were doing what I was doing successfully, I fixated on the fact that if they were doing it, so could I.

        "text": "It’s natural to want people to like you. It’s in our DNA—our ancestors’ survival and ability to find a mate depended largely on acceptance by groups.\n\nHowever, we often compromise ourselves to gain favor with others and be inoffensive. While this approach sometimes delays some initial discomfort, it leads to a path of mediocrity.\n\nThe most successful people are always polarizing to a degree. Leaders, decision makers, entrepreneurs, public figures. They are most often met with high levels of both praise and criticism, whether it’s deserved or not.\n\nThe U.S. President, arguably the most powerful person in the world, is in most cases on both ends of the spectrum for public opinion—they are either reviled, or treated like almost like a living god in some instances. Political bias plays a large role in this, but nonetheless is an example.\n\nThe same approach applies to women. Men who get friend-zoned or not viewed as a potential romantic partner often aren’t polarizing. They are afraid to be sexual, to potentially be offensive, to disagree. Instead of being themselves, they would rather please than encounter potential conflict.\n\nThe internal characteristics that women find most attractive—confidence, boldness, humor, independence of thought—are impossible to achieve if the man is unwilling to stick his neck out and be potentially disagreeable in some way.\n\nSome women will think you’re a dream man, others will think you’re a corny piece of shit and want nothing to do with you.\n\nIf you blend in the background for the sake of being liked, both of those groups of women may view you as a pleasant buddy or friend, but neither will view you in a sexual manner.\n\nWould you rather have most women like you as a platonic friend, or have a good portion of women view you in a romantic/sexual manner, if it means others will reject or dislike you?\n\nThe more success you have, there will be more people that dislike or hate you, and there is nothing you can do. As long as your actions are authentic, and you have a genuine concern for other’s well being, and act on it to the best of your ability, hate shouldn’t bother you.\n\nPress on, be bold. Be willing to be disliked.",

You’ll act as if you were inferior to everyone. You’ll automatically try to please instead of connect to people and just have a shit social life. Right after you talk to people it will always feel as if you weren’t able to fully express yourself.\n\nI feel lonely as fuck right now, i feel like i don't have any friends, but instead,i realized that I could change the way i perceived things.I decided that rather than seeing all that alone time as a curse and remain the same person i am forever,i would take it as a blessing and do everything i could do to change my life. It’s my time,so I can do whatever the fuck i want and eventually the right people will come into it.\n\nIf you’re trying to quit watching porn,smoking weed or anything else you gotta realize that your mind is gonna fuck with you all the time. \n\n« I can reward myself for not doing it this long »\n\n« Anyway it’s too hard »(you know you haven’t given up because you keep trying )\n\nEvery time you got thoughts like that you gotta go deeper and say to yourself:\n\n « Okay it’s just my mind trying to find excuses »\n\n« All of this is nothing more than a cycle, if i keep falling for the same shit again and again, i’ll end up  lying to myself again, pretending that I’m gonna stop doing it this time only to end up doing it again and again over and over »\n\nMy point is, you gotta be aware of your thoughts. If you’re trying to change your behavior, habit, yourself and most importantly your life but you’re not aware of what’s getting you stuck, you won’t change. If you always think the same way, unless you always act before thinking, you will always do the same things that causes you to fail.",

And I’ve done so many AMAs that it seemed boring to me. Hell, I’ve even had redditors to ask me to yell out their favorite movie lines.\n\nI told my team, “What if instead of asking me questions, redditors ask me for advice?” The whole reason Be Useful came to be is that I accidentally stumbled into being a self-help guy. I am all about vision - and my vision was being the greatest bodybuilder of all time, getting into movies, and becoming rich and famous. But I never envisioned that my life would become about helping other people. The more I gave commencement speeches and grew my daily newsletter, Arnold’s Pump Club, the more I realized there was a need for a positive voice out there in all this negativity. People were asking me for advice every day, and I realized I loved helping them more than I love walking down red carpets. So I finally gave in to my agent and wrote my tools for life down in Be Useful. \n\nAnd now I’m here, to give you guys any advice you want or need. I asked around and I was told this community would be the perfect place. Let’s see how this goes. Give me whatever questions you want me to answer. Ask me for advice. Let’s see how I can do. Trust me, I have been on reddit for a decade, I am not a forehead. My advice will never be “Buy the book.”\n\nLet’s go. You guys start and I’ll give you an hour to get some questions going and start trying my best to give you my take on whatever situation you’re in.",

I'm still trying to find myself, not quite sure what career I'm going for, and I'm an okay student who does \"just fine\" without really excelling at anything. I'm extremely unorganized, I struggle with routines, I forget things often, I don't exercise enough so I don't look great, my room is messy, and I find it hard to relate to people. I'm not neurodivergent, I'm just bad at getting friends. Sometimes I feel like I'm an unfinished product, like an early access version of what a human should be.\n\nMy roommate is the exact opposite. He's extremely intelligent and well-spoken, he has a stable job (which he just got promoted to), he has a large group of friends who come over every weekend, he plays the piano better than I've ever heard, he gets up at 7 and goes to bed at 10, he prays and meditates in the mornings, he does all his chores on time with no exceptions, he's a fantastic cook and he exercises routinely and expresses his emotions in a healthy way. He's only three years older than me, but I feel like a teenager in comparison.\n\nI never even realized just how bad I was at life in general until I met this guy. The other day, he took me aside and asked me if I was okay, because he thought I might be depressed. He said he was worried about me because I was in my room a lot, and I'd sometimes forgotten to take out the trash and turn off the lights. That was kind of a wake-up call for me. I don't think I'm depressed, I'm just not very good at being a functional human.\n\nI want to take steps to improve, but I'm wondering if it's even possible for me to reach that level of competence or if our brains are just wired differently.\n\nEDIT: Can y'all stop diagnosing me? People can struggle with things without having ADHD or ADD.  ",

We fantasize about a life with them and our perception of their good and bad traits are misaligned with reality. Putting it simply, shit gets too serious, too soon.\n\nIf you are invested too heavily in someone, and they aren’t as receptive, it’s easy to fall into the trap of chasing this person, or an idealized version you have of them in your head.\n\nIf you are on this path, visualize yourself over the next few years being devoted to this person who does not value you. Imagine yourself finally coming out of the fog, while they’ve disposed of you emotionally long before.\n\nThink of all the amazing people you could have met, the happiness and emotional freedom you could have enjoyed in that time period.\n\nIt’s a cliche, but time is precious. Your time should be valued more than any idealized, emotionally distant person that treats you as afterthought. Only spend your time and energy on those who value you.",

You hear that all the time from old people but the way he said it to me really penetrated. It kinda made me think about how lucky I am.

I’m not perfect by any means and tend to go through depressive periods like everyone, but this almost makes me feel\nGuilty for not taking full advantage of my youth.

You are not failing if the results you want aren’t showing right now. Even if decisions you make now affect you later negatively, in the end it will be okay anyway. \n\nChoose your truth over fear. Choose to step out on your own knowing that whenever you need support, someone will be there. Choose to choose yourself over anyone else. \n\nWhat is best for you will find you. What is meant to be will come to be. Life is a rhythm of highs and lows and in-betweens, but it is all apart of your story. It all matters. Because even if something isn’t meant to happen, redemption and healing can always happen. Mistakes can always be forgiven. Freedom can always be found. You are free to be whoever you dream to be. You are deeply loved through it all. \n\nAt the end of the day what the matters most is how we make other people feel, how we impact them, how we make their life a little bit brighter every moment we have with them. Money matters, but not the most. Pleasure matters, but not the most. Connection matters. Memories matter. Laughter matters. You matter.",

        "text": " \n\nI am 18 and I realized this only about an hour back. For most people in the Post-industrialized era we do not know our fathers. We have grown up seeing our father go to an office we have never seen, come back tired, go to sleep and repeat the cycle next day. Most of us have never seen what our fathers do.\n\nIt isn't glamorous working a 9 to 5 job, it leaves little time for friends or for any other interests. Our fathers are lonely and alone, they have given their 20s, their 30s , their 40s and their 50s to working day in and day out. If you have had the privilege of having a father who never abused you, pushed you ahead and made sure that you had education, internet , clothing and security , know that to give you all of this he had to give up a lot. It has become almost a trend to insult our fathers in the self improvement community as being weak for never having reached an incredible degree of success, for not having been the ideal man we can model ourselves after, but our fathers entered the world alone and gave you everything. Our fathers never cried about the lives they had, our fathers chose to walk to work so that they can save up for our birthday, our fathers have given up their joys to ensure we can have ours.\n\nBefore they had children to take care of, or a marriage or anything for that matter, they were very similar to you. They were artists, musicians, athletes , writers, philosophers and they might have dreamt of giving their lives to one of these arts. They chose stable but draining, monotonous jobs to give you a good life. For the young men out there, grow out of the resentment you have for your father for never being there, appreciate your father. They might not become the incredible artists or athletes they could have once been but they should not be lonely and unappreciated. Show interest in them, learn their knowledge, give them a chance to relive the joys they had long given up. Your father has been waiting for the day he gets to show you what he knows and what he loves, don't make him wait longer.",

I have to create the agenda, make sure everyone can connect, and be the primary presenter and facilitator of discussions.\n\nIt was really uncomfortable at first.

No matter how small, find opportunities wherever you can to consistently take on leadership roles and get outside your comfort zone.\n\nVolunteer, lead your sports team, come up with activities for your social group, request to take on additional leadership assignments at work. Even if these are small, the confidence of stepping outside your comfort zone and leading other people will impact other areas of your life, including your social life.\n\nYou will be more assured, a better communicator, and not be as needy and willing to please others.

I would suggest a mixture of both - add things to your life that will bring value and remove things that don’t, and also practice mindfulness, meditation, make a concerted effort every day to really be present in the nice parts of your day (no scrolling on your phone whilst eating, no headphones when you go for a walk etc.) and experience them completely"

I remember thinking how embarrassed I would have been, what a loser I so would have felt like to keep getting “No!” over and over. But he never gave up his cheerful attitude and just let each “No” roll right off him. You could just tell he wasn’t personalizing the rejections. It was very attractive. So I finally walked up to him and said, “I’ll play darts with you.” Later that night, we were out on the dance floor and he slipped on a puddle of beer and fell down. Everyone around us gasped and I remember being humiliated  for him. I mean, it was so awkward I would have died of embarrassment!! But he just kept dancing (more like wiggling around) on the floor and the crowd that had been staring down at him roared their approval. This guy was so lighthearted and easygoing, nothing affected his confidence and mood! Anyway, we’ve been married almost 25 years now. :)"

        "text": "My whole life I’ve been concerned about how people  perceive me. I want to be liked, loved, and accepted. This is a human need since we are social creatures. Having experienced my fair share of abandonment, loss, and grief in my life at an early age, I developed some thought patterns that thought these needs weren’t being met so I clung to the need even more and molded myself into taking action that I thought everyone wanted me to take instead of what I actually wanted. \n\nI constantly agreed to things that I didn’t want to do out of fear that I would be abandoned once again, if even only in the thoughts of other people thinking that I wasn’t lovable or likable because I wasn’t doing what they wanted of me. \n\nThis trend continued in my life in so many ways, I’d mold my personality, appearance, desires, paths, all in the name of being acceptable in someone else’s opinion. \n\nOne day, I finally cracked. Beaten down by an adderall addiction, voluntary starvation, at a job I hated, a college major I despised, in a fake relationship I thought was the best thing I had going for me, I existed as a hollow shell who didn’t know who she was. \n\nThere had to be another way. \nSo I had to flip my life as I knew it upside and do everything I thought I shouldn’t do so I could finally find myself once again. \n\nOne of the common habits I’ve always had is saying yes to what I don’t want to do because it’s what someone else wants from me. I didn’t realize, though, that every-time I did that, I was actually saying no to something for me. If I spend my time doing something I don’t want to do with resentfulness, I say no to the time I could be spending doing something for myself and my own inner peace. This also applies to things that have absolutely nothing to do with others such as my own thoughts or actions.\n\nThis morning I set my silent alarm for 5:55 and an actual sound one for 6:30 because I wanted to go running before work. I went running on Monday too, and that was the first time I did so in months. I woke up the earliest I have in so long on Monday and the whole day I was grounded and confident and felt good. Since I had been dealing with a lot of anxious thoughts the last few months, I knew something had to change so I took control of what I could. \n\nWhen the 5:55 alarm went off I debated getting up at the moment but didn’t. Then the sound alarm rang and I immediately had the thought, “if I say yes to staying in bed, what am I saying no to?” This was a surprising thought because it’s not one that every really came up before immediately at 6:30AM but I also feel it’s just proof of the inner shift through thought work and self-improvement that are sticking. I was saying no to doing something good for my body (yoga and running), I was saying no to feeling accomplished, I was saying no to alone time which is rare since my boyfriend and I both work at home and we don’t do anything because of covid so time by myself is harder to come by these days. I was saying no to all of these wonderful things compared to saying yes to staying in bed which is what I did for the past few months and it didn’t make me feel good when I just ignored my alarm or internal clock that woke me up but I decided to sleep and ended up more groggy and just rolling out of bed right before I had to sign on for work. \n\nSo saying yes to something you don’t want to do becomes more of an obvious issue when you think of what you’re giving up. Opportunity costs I guess for my business people. They’re real and they impact our lives in many ways. I thought I was doing good deeds when I said yes to something I didn’t want to do but truthfully I was also saying yes to resentment and saying no to so many other things that would be better use of my time & energy which are our most important resources. \n\nI invite you to ask yourself next time you feel an “obligation” to say yes in order to please someone else, what’s the cost? What are you saying no to? Making informed decisions instead of ones out of fear of rejection or abandonment has been such an important tool for me on this journey. I’m not perfect at it, but I know every time I evaluate this, I feel a million times better because I usually end up choosing the one that is best for me.",

My plan to get out of the dark place I am now is: \n\n- Develop and follow a routine \n- Take care of my needs \n- Follow a healthy diet \n- Exercise frequently \n- Get out of my comfort zone more often \n- Have a good sleep schedule \n- Practice mindfulness \n- Study more (and in a healthier way) \n- Read a book per month \n- Find a better work-life balance \n- Improve my emotional state and get my anxiety better. \n- Dedicate myself more to adapt to the country I live in. \n\nIf you have a good word or quote of motivation, I’ll be grateful. It has been tough in here, but I don’t plan to give up!\n\nEDIT 1: I know some comments are harsh regarding the upvotes part. My one and only intention was to feel supported and to commit to those believing in me and taking their time to read this and share nice words. I was not expecting so many kind words, nor honestly that many upvotes of those kind strangers. I am feeling supported and appreciated, and when you have such a hard time making life work, believe me, it makes a huge difference. Thanks kind strangers :)\n\nEDIT 2: any tips to follow my new journey are more than welcome. Books, resources, habits. I am deeply interested in learning how can I make this the best.",

        "text": "For most of my life, I've been convinced that I don't work the same way as other people in that I'll never become good at anything even if I spend time on it. I think being shitty at sports as a kid kinda fucked me up later in life by ensuring I would never spend too much time doing anything so that I would never have to be let down if I didn't make any progress. Another habit I started picking up (mainly as a defense mechanism) was that if I spent more time reading about an activity than actually doing it, I could convince myself that I was being productive and actually working towards something. This was a dangerous mindset to get into because 1) it caused to me feel a sense of accomplishment in the short term without having anything to actually show for it and 2) it intensified my feelings of personal disappointment when I DID manage to attempt something new and find out that I'm not very good at it, leading me to sink back into my \"reading and not doing\" state. It all starts to turn into this vicious cycle of picking things up and immediately putting them down, fulfilling my own prophecy of never being good at anything. \n\nSo now I'm age 30 and we've been in the middle of a pandemic for a year where I've had a lot of time to reflect and work on myself. I've been forcing myself to get over my fear of sucking at things and just start doing them regardless in the hope that I'll eventually start seeing improvements over time. It really sucks to see how much further ahead my friends are when it comes to their hobbies and skills, but I'm becoming a bit more hopeful every day that I can get to that level if I just put the time into the things I wanna get better at every day, (NOT just reading about them) even if there are days where I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.

        "text": "There was an interesting experiment concerning workers who weren't saving up enough money for their retirement. The researches made them visualise their future self, which included everything from digital visualisation to writing letters \"to myself in 20 years\".\n\nThese people started saving up a lot more than before. And the scientists were like, ahh the reason we don't care about our future self is that it's too abstract! We literally can't connect to it without some hardcore computer stimulation. Great work guys, problem solved.\n\nSo, today I was thinking about every time I self-sabotaged in the past. Everything from binge watching a show instead of sleeping to that one time I didn't submit my Master's thesis on time, which set me back about 2 years.\n\nAnd I realised, it's not that I didn't care for my future self. I love my future self. I always imagine her to be way more together than I am now, and also wise and successful. Possibly looking great for a middle aged woman.\n\nBut then, there's the past self. What I realised today, my relationship with her is much worse and that often comes up when I'm about to make an important decision. Like with that Master's thesis - I hated myself for procrastinating the previous year, so I kept on procrastinating. **Because working hard would be an act of self love, and all I felt was self hate.**\n\nSo the future self suffered. I still suffer the consequences in some ways actually, though it's been 5 years. I AM that future self. Hello.\n\nMeanwhile, what is the past self doing?\n\nShe doesn't exist. Unlike the future self, which does. In some ways she's more real than the present self (Zen masters would disagree).\n\nSo I guess my conclusion is, the best thing we can do for ourselves is forgive and forget the past self, let her go, and do something wholesome right now.",

It's harder to get housing for security and it's harder to get disposable income to do the things that you find meaningful. You can't really find what you want or find any purpose when you are stuck in the cycle of working hard to meet your basic needs, so people in their 20s just decide that maybe they don't want to play that game.

Scrolling for hours and hours seeing the worst of society is terrifying and seeing the best of society makes you feel worthless. Cheap dopamine hits from online shopping, porn, upvotes, and constant stream of content messes up the reward system of your brain.

It can be simple. \r\n\r\nNow believe me, I have incredible empathy for anyone who feels unconfident in themselves when it comes to their social/dating lives, and is currently putting a lot of mental energy into this area of their life. I've been there, and I know how demotivating it can be to feel like you're an awkward person or that you're a burden on the people around you.\r\n\r\nNow what I did to overcome the problems in my confidence was… \r\n\r\n>> I let my fear tell me what actions I should take \r\n\r\nThe more I was afraid to do something, the bigger the indication that I needed to do that thing (as long as it wouldn't put my or someone else's life at risk of course, let's not get silly here lol).\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to approach strangers, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to pick up a phone call, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to socialize in group settings, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to be vulnerable and go on dates, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\nOnce, I was at my friend's mom's funeral, and the time came where we were asked if we wanted to share any words about her with the group. I obviously wanted to, but I felt a great fear inside my chest-- I didn't want to look stupid in front of everyone.\r\n\r\nBut I remembered this rule that I set for myself, and because I was afraid, I went up anyway. I began weeping in front of everyone as I recounted a story of us during my childhood. My friend started weeping as well-- it meant the world to him.\r\n\r\nBecoming comfortable with the uncomfortable is how you can truly become a confident person.\r\n\r\nI hope this inspires you to take action. As cliché as it sounds: if there is fear, you have to face it. \r\n\r\nOkay, if you need more help with your social/dating life, reach out to me. I try to help as many people as I can, so just explain what is going on for you and we can see if I can help.\r\n\r\nChef kiss!",

Only the most attentive people visibly recognized my pain such as my teacher of psychology. \n\nSometimes perceived confidence comes from unconscious bodily processes I think.

        "text": "It's kind of a vicious circle. You are afraid of something and so you avoid doing it. Because you didn't do it, you give yourself the signal that it's very hard for you to do it and so you get a little bit more anxious. The next time you're in the same situation you are a little bit more afraid and so you avoid it again which starts the circle again.\n\nWhat I found out to be very effective is, that we actively WANT to expose ourselves to situations that are frightening to us. I know that for a lot of us it's too overwhelming to just go out and talk to someone. But you don't have to jump into the cold water right away, you can also MENTALLY prepare yourself for it by feeling your anxiety and getting to know it. Your brain can't tell the difference between a real situation or the pictures you make in your head, that's why mentally exposing yourself to situations where you feel anxiety is so effective. Because what we are often afraid of is not the situation but more the feeling of anxiety itself. So we are anxious about being anxious. If we apply a mindfulness practice for example and learn to feel the anxiety when it comes up, we slowly but surely break the circle. \n\nHope that helps you ❤️",

This worked out well in school where I did well academically compared to my peers. But once I went to college, I was surrounded with people who were much better than me at everything. I was having a hard time keeping up classes. I started getting anxiety issues and my academics started worsening. This drove me futher into depression. It took me months to get out of it. Similar episodes happened to me later when my life didn't go on the track that I had planned. Job rejections, a break-up, etc. Each time my world would come crashing down on me and I would feel that this is the end of my life as I've known it. I found it so difficult to cope up with a life different from what I had planned and a life where things aren't always perfect. It drove me to suicidal thoughts because I thought a life less than perfect is not worth living. \n\nI don't know how long I will continue struggling with this habit of mine. But if you have kids who are over-achievers in childhood, I would urge you to make them take up a few activities which they are not the best at. This will help them learn how to cope up with failures, rejections and undesired outcomes.",

But I really came here to say, “don’t beat yourself up.”  \n\nSomewhere between parents and teachers and society, we’re all kind of sold that things snap into place in adulthood. Then people get to adulthood and beat themselves up because they don’t have it all figured out. They feel like they’re behind, like they’re wasting their life. I see this all the time in subs like r/findapath. \n\nThe real life pro tip:  NO ONE ever has it ALL figured out and less-so people in their 20’s. No one’s path or schedule has to be your own. You don’t have to “keep up” with your peers. Maybe your path looks like a maze in a Highlights magazine, while someone else’s is straight, or on an upward trajectory. All ok.\n\nAnd feeling like your world is crashing down when things don’t go right?  Totally normal for young adults. Perspective comes from age and experience. Once I hit my 30’s I realized that none of the world ending problems actually ended my world and that many of those problems seemed almost silly now. After that it gets easier to look at today’s challenges and realize it probably won’t matter much in a decade. That’s not to say I don’t still get depressed or anxious over disappointment or challenges, but I can work through those feelings a lot quicker with perspective and get back on track. \n\nIf you’re not failing sometimes, you’re not challenging yourself. A certain amount of failure is healthy for personal growth. \n\nI wish you luck and health and determination."

Like, what the fuck am I doing with my life? I'm legit crying while I type this because I have no fucking idea what I want to do. I know what I need to do, I need to start taking care of myself. Get a job (I've never had a job before, so this will be hard)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut damn. I am scared I haven't been taking care of myself at all. One day I'll be homeless because my mom can't take care of me forever. I have no one else. This sucks. But I know I need to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here goes nothing. Going to try to come up with some plans. I hope it's okay if I post updates here. I'm normally on 8chan and sometimes 4chan...

You woke up at 1 today? Set an alarm for 11am, or 12pm even. When you've got that down - keep moving it towards your desired point. The goal is only important as a marker - it's all about the process.  \n\n\nI forget who said it, but you're only as good as the systems you make. Make it so you have the least resistance towards your desired new habits. Wanna improve self-hygiene? Have your towel ready by your bed so it can be the first thing you do when you wake up. Can you see what I mean? Make it easy for yourself.\n\nLast of all, go easy on yourself. I think this sub can have the tendency to go all David Goggins-esque bullshit and try to become their own drill-sergeants. Forgive yourself when you fall short. I'm sitting here on my laptop - I \"should have\" meditated and journalled before bed today, but I watched videos instead. I'm not going to beat myself up about it - I'm just going to put steps ahead (leave my laptop downstairs etc.) in to make sure I do it tomorrow. Self-compassion is the best motivator you can have - be kind to yourself. Good luck."

I saw my unwashed bedding, filthy carpet, untidy desk, and I realised that it didn’t look that much different from when we’d been living together. I realised that he’d been keeping me back, making me feel terrible for being the breadwinner. \n\nHe stripped away the last money I had when we separated and I was down to my last few dollars. \n\nI suddenly started cleaning and I couldn’t stop. I was overwhelmed, possessed to clean and clean until everything was spotless. \n\nI started making my bed every day. Cooking all my food healthy, exercising, reading more, working harder at the office. \n\nI got a promotion, I’m getting my teeth fixed. I’m going to the gym 3 times a week. \n\nPeople say they don’t recognise me. I’m so insanely happy all the time. Even when work sucks and I’m dead tired I feel so secure and accomplished. It’s not a chore anymore, I’m just me, the best version of me. \n\nI take my depression medication every day and I genuinely think my depression is in remission.

My father is became abusive and heavily drug dependant for a few years. \nI am 19 now and the last time I spoke to him was when I was 15. \n\nHe is a top tier scientist and this year after a life long passion for all kinds of science I chose the same career path as him. (Not because of him but because my own love for the thing)\n\nEvery three months I have to send him an email and briefly tell him if something important (like my address, phone number...) Changed. \nSo I did that yesterday telling him that I got accepted to the best university in my country into a biochemistry course, the same course and school he attended. \nAnd to be honest I little bit hoped he would reply with something at least slightly nice. \n\nHe replied calling me a Mr. instead of my name. Told me that I am not his son anymore and basically blamed the wole divorce on me in a long and hateful paragraph. \n\nI called my mom, shared the mail with my girlfriend, had it on the back of my mind the whole damn day... To be honest even after being physically and mentally abused for 6 years straight, getting sued by him multiple, literally watching trying to kidnap my 4yo sister, this still really hurts. And I don't even know why do I care so much. \n\nThe only thing I can do now is to cope in a healthy way... And this is what is this post about. I have decided to cope in a healthy and mature way this time. And even though my entire being literally just wants to get drunk and self harm I'm not going to do it:) \nI will visit my family instead, spend some extra time with my girlfriend and cat, get some quality alone time.. whatever just to relax and clear my head. \n\nSo fuck you dad, you won't get the best of me this time.",

        "text": "One of the biggest myths that many buy in to is that there is only one special person out there for them. This limiting mindset leads to neediness, a willingness to please, putting their partners on a pedestal, and other self-sabotaging behaviors.\n\nIf the relationship doesn’t work, someone in this frame of mind will waste precious time and opportunity on their ex, who either rejected them, or just simply isn’t compatible.\n\nThis flawed belief of ‘the one’ leads to fixation on an idealized, fantasy version of their ex, not the real person. That person’s negative qualities and the issues in the relationship are overlooked or ignored, because romantic hopes are being projected onto them, instead of realizing that things ended for a reason.\n\nDo not buy into the myth. There is not one single soulmate for everyone. Based purely on population numbers, there are a multitude of people that you would connect with. It’s tragic to see this opportunity traded in for fixation on an imagined, idealized version of someone.\n\nThe best relationships come when there is mutual prioritization. Trying to convince someone to take you back will typically yield the same results. For whatever reason, they felt they didn’t need you in their lives at some point, enough to cut things off. Even if you manage to win them back, they still inherently do not value you. Once the infatuation fades again, the same issues will typically come to the surface again.",

It feels good not having that grime on my teeth, and I really want to try to build a habit. \n\nWith depression, I found my self care really suffered. So, knowing that I'm working out and taking the moment to take care of myself, I'm happy. I know I'm exercising hard and the sun burn proves it. Ofc I hurt my shoulder so I can't play tennis right now, but I am still doing agility and working out. It feels good. \n\nStrangely I feel like I'm taking care of myself. I'm being honest with my emotions for the first time in forever, and I am not letting my parents ... control me. \n\nSo, yeah. I brushed my teeth today and I am proud of that.\n\nEdit: Oh, wow. I didn't expect this to take off like it did. I'm so appreciative that I am not the only one has had this particular trouble. I am so appreciative of everyone here, and I really just appreciate the community here.",

        "text": "All of us want to wake up with an abundance of energy and motivation. Everyone wants to have unlimited amounts of willpower and discipline. Yet, our lives do not always turn out to be that way. \n\nAs soon as we turn off our alarm clocks, we begin our mornings with social media and YouTube. After wasting 20 precious minutes, we get up, broken and sleepy. We rush to our bathroom to do our business, to rinse our faces and brush our teeth. We hastily make our breakfast which contains nothing except tons of carbs and unhealthy fats. We brew our cup of coffee and start to fill our bodies with rubbish. Another 20 minutes later and we gotta go to school/work where we spend 8 hours sitting. \n\nThis is the way most of us live. We crave change. We can feel that something isn’t right. However, are we ready to act on that? It’s not easy to refuse to eat hollow foods. It’s not easy to lay your phone aside and sleep. It’s not easy to go for a run. \n\nIf you are tired of seeking the perfect routine or habits, you’ve come to the right place. There will be no bullshit and there will be no controversial topics.  Spoiler alert! You already know most of the stuff I’m going to tell here. However, why the hell did you not implement it, huh? Reading my post won’t alter you. You need to actually commit to the habits I present here to perceive the tangible change. \n\n**Sleep.**\n\nIf your sleep schedule is fucked up and you have no desire to fix it, then you can go fuck yourself with your meditation, exercise and proper nutrition. \n\nI can’t emphasize how important this point. Without proper rest, your incredible diet or training will be almost useless. Your ability to remember and recall information will decrease dramatically and you will not live your life to the fullest. And that’s not everything. Sleep deprivation is a dangerous thing that can increase your chances of dying earlier than you expect. \n\n“But I don’t have time! I have to do my homework, hang out with my friends, and eat pizza”. Bullshit. How many hours do you spend on YouTube or social media? 3 hours? 4 hours? Well, then it’s time to set priorities, brother. Either your health or additional hours of scrolling through endless news feeds.\n\n**Diet.**\n\nStop eating junk. Stop eating shit for breakfast. Stop filling your stomach with garbage in the evening. Buy some veggies and fruit. Try to eat more protein and fibre. Don’t forget about the vitamins and essential metals. \n\nOnce a week or two weeks, allow yourself to eat some chocolate or crisps. Don’t be stupidly harsh. Your body won’t like it.\n\n**Exercise.**\n\nWalk, ride a bike, do some push-ups, just get your blood flowing, man. Don’t be afraid to experiment and change your routine sometimes as well. Instead of running, try to cycle. Instead of doing calisthenics, pay a visit to the gym or boxing class. \n\n“But if I do cardio and weights, I will burn all my muscles and become a skinny dog”\n\nAre you a professional athlete who is capable of becoming the best? Are you a man/woman who earns money from sports? No? Then why do you limit yourself to one sport? Your goal is to be healthy and vital, not to show off your six-pack to girls.\n\n**Reading.**\n\n>“My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer and I have my mind...and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge. That's why I read so much Jon Snow.”\n\nI like the way George R.R. Martin addresses this point. In the first book of his series The Song of Ice and Fire, he compares books to a whetstone. He is not lying. Many studies have been conducted by famous universities and they discovered the same thing.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you read. The process of deciphering symbols on paper is challenging for our brains. Don’t forget to mix it up and get out of your comfort zone occasionally. If you’ve been reading sci-fi for the past two months, pick up non-fiction or some kind of biography. \n\nReading books in a foreign language is an incredible way to increase the benefits of reading to their fullest. Your brain needs to accomplish more work and strain more. However, that’s a topic for another day.\n\n**Mediation.**\n\nAgain, so many studies have been conducted on this subject. And I’m sure that you’ve seen tons of articles and videos on YouTube about it.\n\nIn 20 minutes a day, you can improve your mood, fluid intelligence, focus, self-control, willpower, and other things. \n\nIf you only have spare 10-20 minutes, that is the best way you can spend them.\n\nI especially advise meditation to those who are suffering from anxiety disorders. It will do wonders for you.\n\n**Listening.**\n\nEven if what they are saying is wrong. Listen. Do not interrupt. Then, after they finished, ask them questions about their point of view. Try to walk in their shoes and understand the way they think. Maybe you don’t know or missing something. Perhaps you are mistaken and they are right. You won’t come to a conclusion with mere interruption and arguing. That’s another human being in front of you, not a monster who is trying to deceive you.\n\n**Progressive overload.**\n\nProgressive overload is a concept I took from the bodybuilding community. It’s a method of increasing your muscle size, strength, and endurance by gradually increasing the stress you put on your nervous and musculoskeletal systems. In other words, it means to progressively increase the difficulty of an exercise to stop yourself from hitting a plateau or doing what’s comfortable.\n\nIf you want to advance in this life. If you want to reach new heights. You gotta apply this technique. You are not going to create your dream body or a giant business by meditating and sitting on a couch.\n\nI challenge you to do at least one uncomfortable thing every single day and observe the way your life will transform.\n\nBy the way, don’t forget about **rest**. Every competent bodybuilder or athlete will tell you that growth doesn’t happen in the gym. It happens at home.\n\nReward yourself. Play video games. Sit on social media. Watch Minecraft videos on YouTube. Just, don’t allow those things to take over your schedule.\n\nThanks for reading this hell of a post.",

The recommended daily time for exercising is one hour. Before exercising, you need to warm up with stretches. After exercising, you need to cool down too.\n\nThis is a big change for my lazy lifestyle, so much that I felt too intimidated to even begin. I would spend an entire day trying to convince myself to start exercising until the day is finished. \n\nBut when I started small, I gradually saw improvements :) At first all I can manage were random jumping jacks or squats in between study sessions. When I got comfortable with moving my body around daily, I was able to follow a 15 minute workout on YouTube. When I get used to that, I'll move onto doing 20 minutes, then 30 minutes, work my way up to an hour.\n\nTo those who want to start making changes in your life like the post mentioned, go at your own pace. If you set unrealistic expectations for yourself, you might disappoint yourself or not even manage to begin. A little bit everyday will add up, you might not even realize that it accumulated into a big success until some time later.\n\nAlso another tip I saw here that worked for me. Leave your phone outside your room when you go to sleep. So when you wake up in the morning, you can't scroll thru social media in your bed anymore. I'm going to buy an alarm clock to replace my phone as an alarm.\n\nThat's all. Thank you OP for this post. Good luck to everyone."

My goal is to be able to describe mathematically something I see occur between people interacting. I certainly do see it but it may not be quantifiable considering free will.

Due to that, I will probably always be single without my own family. What I can do however is get smart! I absolutely hate feeling dumb and that is what I think is driving me. I've been sober now for 19 years tomorrow and This whole process has been one of improving oneself. I've gained a lot of insight and I'm hoping math will be a ticket to recognition of some kind which could, in turn, make me desirable to women again.

I get why they are used and how formulas are formed but the equations themselves? Totally throw me off the moment there’s an x or y or an a or b or whatever.\n\nDon’t get me started on fractions. I just...... my brain doesn’t want to. Which is wild because as a musician fractions are used to tell you what time signature you’re playing in. IE how many beats per bar. Which I get because I’m a classically trained pianist but when fractions are used in Math?\n\nNope. Does not compute. \n\nYou can do this. It will take time and patience but you can do this."

        "text": "“I’m a failure because I don’t have a good job. Because I haven’t found a special someone yet. Because my body isn’t the right shape. Because I’m poor. Who I am is not good enough.”\n\nWhy do so many people relate to those words? Why is the default mental narrative of so many people “I’m a failure and I have no hope of getting better”?\n\nWho put those poisonous words in your head? Who taught you to feel so much shame? I don’t think this is you. I think you’re trying to live someone else’s life, walk in someone else’s shoes and stumbling because they don’t fit right.\n\nBecause society has a lot of expectations about your life. Society has a scoring rubric about what a good career looks like, or a happy relationship, or a flawless body. Society projects a lot of ideals onto us about the “right life.” And I think you’re breaking your toes trying to fit into a shoe that was never made for you.\n\nI’m not trying to tell you that you’re a special star in your own way and you’re better than society’s stupid ideals. If you’re anything like me, you’ve got issues, you have scars, and there’s a lot you want to do better. And it’s good to try and get better. But you’re not going to go very far while you keep hobbling in that ridiculously poor fitting shoe.\n\nYou are not a failure just because you don’t fit the mold life tried to force onto you. Everyone has different experiences growing up, different skills, different passions, different fears. How insane is it that we could all turn out the same way? The mold society has is just a guide that helps society survive. \n\nIf everyone in a society tries to be healthy and climb the ladder at work then the society will have a good economy and prosper. That’s the point of the mold. It’s not designed to make you happy, it’s not designed with an individual in mind, and it is impossible that more than a handful of random people could fit it perfectly. That’s why we glorify workaholics and people that volunteer and successful entrepreneurs. These are all individuals that happen to benefit the economy or their community. Society teaches us to value the things that are good for society - not us.\n\nYou are not a failure. You are just trying to wear someone else’s shoes. So stop tearing yourself apart. Stop saying “I’m a failure because X” and ask if X is actually important to you or if society just said it was. Ask yourself what is really important to you, and focus on that. \n\nI spent so many nights hating myself because my career was mundane. I felt broken because I was introverted and didn’t like going out. I thought I was hideous and ugly because I didn’t have a six pack. I thought something was wrong with me because I didn’t know how to be what society wanted.\n\nThat’s horseshit. Working 80 hours a week isn’t actually important to me. Going to bars or clubs wasn’t important to me. And I could be perfectly healthy without having a six pack. So why did I treat those like failures? \n\nI don’t know you. I don’t know things about yourself you really want to change and which parts simply don’t match the blueprint society gave you. But I need you to think about it. I need you to ask yourself what is really important. Ask yourself who you want to be. Because society doesn’t know what is best for you. And life won’t get better until you figure that out for yourself.\n\nThe best you is someone who enjoys each day. Someone who doesn’t tear themselves apart because their values are different than society’s. Someone who learns what is important to them and tries to be a better version of themself - not someone who tries to be someone else.\n\nAccepting who you are doesn’t mean you’re perfect and shouldn’t try to improve. It just means **you’re not a failure for who you are today.** We’re all works in progress. And if we stop hating ourselves for 5 minutes we can look around and enjoy taking one step forward today even if there’s a lot of steps left. \n\nWhen you get to the end, it’s over. When you get to your last step you’re going to wish you had taken your time and smelled the roses along the way. You’re never going to be perfect. So don’t wish away the days that you’re getting better. Try to accept who you are and enjoy them. \n\nStop trying to live someone else’s life. This is your life, and you can’t get it back once it is gone.\n\nFurther reading: If this resonated with you then I highly recommend “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coelho. It’s a short novel about finding what is important to you, and it’s helped a lot of people disengage from the society life gave them that they never wanted. You will never be happy while living someone else’s life. Take off those horrible shoes. They’re causing you so much pain, you’ll go much farther when you live the life that fits you.",

        "text": "I have had 3 long-term relationships in my life. One started when I was 18 the summer before I went to college. We met at a party when we were both on molly. He was a little older (22) and I had never had a guy that interested in me before. I was usually the one chasing crushes because i felt I wasn’t good enough and they proved me right over and over. This time, I had someone actually trying to get to know me. It felt good. I needed that validation so bad. Am I worthy of other people? Do I have something to offer? This question constantly rolled through my subconscious. \n\nWhen I went to college, he got possessive. I was rooming with my best friend since I was 2 and 8 hours away. I secluded myself that first year. I didn’t want to fuck up a relationship because I finally had someone who “loved me” and who was I to mess that up? I was the girl who was always abandoned. I was the one who everyone left. So, I made sure that didn’t happen. I always answered his calls when I was out. I left the parties when he was mad. I cried my eyes out when he screamed at me and apologized for going out. I became severely depressed at college and transferred home. We dated for over a year after I came home. I realized that if I truly loved myself, I wouldn’t be in this relationship. I couldn’t deal with being controlled or mistrusted when I wasn’t doing anything wrong. I broke up with him even though I had thought i loved him. I realized that it was a great lesson but I deserved more. \n\nWe broke up in October of 2011. I started to get involved in after school activities  at the community college i was attended. I joined a co-Ed fraternity. I was addicted to adderall because it helped me do stuff I didn’t want to do like school work or socialize due to the horrible circumstances i had at my first school with being rejected by every girl my age. I was at my lowest weight and had a eating disorder that was made much easier by taking addedall. I was the person people wanted to be friends with. I had a new sense of fake self-worth. I was “pretty and skinny and everyone liked me”. Only who they liked was a façade. I molded who i was to be the person i thought i should be. I met my next boyfriend at a New Year’s Eve party. He asked if I wanted to be his beer pong partner. We clicked immediately. He had been dating someone we knew mutually that cheated on him. No one was allowed to talk to him while they were dating because she was controlling. I had a new crush. \n\nI decided to message him on Facebook asking him for his number. I had never done something like that before but I was the “new me”. The outgoing girl. The one who people liked, so I showed no fear. He told me later when we were dating he had the messenger open to ask me for my number. Anyway, our relationship was really good in the beginning. I was “confident”. We “loved” each other. He lived at campus during school and was studying to be a mechanical engineer. I was newly accepted into a prestigious business school in the city for accounting. We seemed to have it all. When he graduated (he was a year younger than me, and I was still in school) we decided to move in together. I got a full time job while going to school full time, he was working full time as a mechanical engineer. I had been depressed but the adderall helped me do what I had to. I would work 9 hours and go to school for 4-5 hours afterwards. Leave at 6AM get home around 10:30PM. I was drowning. \n\nI realized I didn’t want to do accounting but I couldn’t tell him that because how would he like me if I wasn’t who he thought I was. He didn’t know I took adderall. He didn’t know I was still smoking cigarettes when we told each other we’d quit together. He didn’t know me. At all. It wasn’t his fault, I was scared to show anyone the real me. I was anxious about the double life I was leading everyday. I hated myself and believed if I showed anyone who i really was, I wouldn’t be accepted. So I kept the charade going for a while. Then he found my cigarettes. He caught me in lies all the time. I quit the full time job because I was so depressed. I stopped attending a lot of classes. He was exercising a lot and eating healthy, I was not eating at all except for when I’d run out of adderall and binge. We stopped liking each other. He couldn’t trust me because I always lied. I don’t blame him. I lied to myself everyday so how could I be authentic to anyone else? I stopped taking adderall and that’s when shit hit the fan. I started reading spiritual books and doing self improvement. I became involved in a spiritual community that helped. He thought it was a cult. I stopped smoking cigarettes and realized that I had been living a lie for so long. I gained a lot of weight and was in a deep depression again from withdrawals and dealing with things that were suppressed while taking adderall. I didn’t want to go out much. I didn’t want to do anything. Whenever I tried to talk to him about how i was feeling he’d shut me out. He didn’t have the capacity to deal with me. I realized the relationship was doomed because I had not been myself the entire time. I was finally beginning to understand who i was and he hated it more each day. We broke up after a snowboarding trip. I got stranded on top and he thought I was overreacting when I fell. I was a hypochondriac so I can’t blame him for not believing me but I was really hurt. I couldn’t get down and had to be taken down by two professionals. he wouldn’t drive me to a hospital until we got home. He didn’t talk the entire 5 hours even after we got pulled over twice for speeding. I moved out two months later, by myself - we lived in an apartment above his grandparents. I was still recovering and was just off crutches but he wouldn’t come assist. His grandparents couldn’t believe it. \n\nI turned 25 and was single for the first time in my adult life. I didn’t know how to do dating apps. I didn’t know how to be by myself. I realized that was my problem all along. I was always clinging to people because of my deep rooted fear of abandonment. I’d mold myself into someone I wasn’t because I didn’t like myself or love myself. I’d play a part. And I was done. \n\nI did a lot of self-improvement over that year. My dad was really sick with Parkinson’s and dementia. My mom got cancer. It was a whirlwind. I lived with them in a tiny apartment until they decided they were going to move to Florida. I got a new part time job and then it turned into full time because of my hard work. I started to prioritize my health after seeing what my dad and mom were going through. I decided that I had to take care of me instead of worrying about filling some void. Too many things were going on that were more important than me trying to date again. I moved into an apartment above my cousins house when my parents moved. I was essentially living by myself for the first time since I didn’t have to answer to anyone. I loved the freedom. I could come and go as I pleased. I started to really dive into spiritual practices. I viewed my abandonment issues and started to heal them. I realized that everyone I ever dated served a purpose, but I jumped into relationships for the wrong reasons. I dated two people short-term and realized rather quickly i couldn’t keep doing that because I was constantly needing to validate myself through someone else. I was done with that part of my life. \n\nI realized deep down, I never believed I was worthy. I’d jump into things immediately and ignore all flags. I wasn’t a good girlfriend, because I didn’t know how to love myself at all. I didn’t do a good job in my previous relationships which is 100% on me, but I also chose people who weren’t a good fit. No matter what, we wouldn’t have worked out for the long haul. I decided enough was enough. I deleted all my dating apps and decided to focus fully on me without worrying about someone else. \n\nA few days later, I received a text saying, “my phone broke I hope we’re still on for Tuesday.” It was from someone I was talking to on the dating apps and really felt he was different until he ghosted me. He worked 5 minutes from my job and we had agreed to go out after work on May 16, 2017. I had decided that day instead of Monday because it was anniversary of my first dads passing which is always a weird day for me. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and we went on our date. \n\nI showed up not trying to be anyone but myself. I was tired of pretending. I had accepted myself for who I was, flaws and all and no longer cared about what other people though about me because if they don’t like me, then that’s fine. We’re still dating and just moved in together. It’s a relationship I could’ve never had before I started to love myself and realize I deserve respect and trust. I don’t do anything to self-sabotage in it because I don’t fear being abandoned. If it’s meant to be, it will and I’ll try my very best to make it last. I’m honest about all the things I was never honest about, because I don’t have this fear in the back of my mind that if he knows the real me he’ll leave. I know i manifested this relationship and it’s beautiful and healthy and nothing like anything I could’ve ever imagined when I wasn’t loving myself. \n\nYou are deserving of a great relationship. You deserve to be with someone who knows you, flaws and all. But you have to do the work too. You give what you get in relationships. If you have things from prior ones you need to heal, please do it. I know what it’s like to self-sabotage things out of fears of being left. I know what it’s like to lie for so long and be caught in those lies. Tell the truth. To yourself and to other people. Be your own best friend. Be okay with being alone, because being alone doesn’t mean you have to be lonely. Once you love yourself, you can truly love other people. I used to never believe that but I know first hand how true it is now. The most important relationship you’ll ever have is the one with yourself, but you can also have extremely beautiful connections with other people on their journey. Your relationship with yourself sets the tone for everyone other one in your life. Practice love. Practice forgiveness. Heal your past hurts. Have compassion. Be respectful. Be authentic. Once you do these things for yourself, it will manifest towards other people. \n\n_ \n\nTLDR: You are deserving of a great relationship. You deserve to be with someone who knows you, flaws and all.

        "text": "If you had crippling social anxiety and want to break away from it, don't be like me.\n\nA year ago I was so sick and tired of being an introvert with sa and determined to overcome my fear of public speaking.\n\nI read a bunch of self-help books that encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and take \"massive action\". I was so pumped and so ready to charge right at a big challenge and change myself once and for all. I signed up for multiple public speaking opportunities at conferences, meetings and seminars in front of hundreds of people. I made sure I know the topics well and I rehearse multiple times before the speeches.\n\nBut man did I fail horribly. I was all shaking before I got on the stage. I sweat, stumbled, froze, brain went blank. I skipped a whole section of a speech. I ended up having to make up a bunch of excuses just to get myself off the remaining speeches. The shame haunted me for 6 good months and I avoided talking to people, even my friends. I even went to therapy for it.\n\nDon't be stupid like me. Don't destroy your mental health for your growth. Take baby steps. Be strategic with your time, opportunities and energy. Some changes take consistent and patient work, over months even years.\n\nI also realized that the area outside of comfort zone is more complex than I thought. Kudos to you if you have the courage to step outside of your comfort zone. You can find growth there, but there's also a panic zone you want to steer clear from.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n**Edit:**\n\nDidn't expect this to blow up.. but thank you all for the support and comments!\n\nIn terms of public speaking, highly recommend an online group called \"the mouthfuls\" (on meetup and discord), they have daily 1-minute impromptu speaking sessions/events and the community is very supportive. I think it's great for low-stake, baby-step exposure therapy. Really helpful for rebuilding my confidence along the way.",

I did research and found someone who had prior experience in counseling, holistic medicine, massage, and hospitality.\n\nI straight up told them my condition and why I sought them out specifically.\n\nI was so bad at first that I was shaking even at the thought of being held but she helped eased me into it. She was caring and kind to my emotions. Afterwards I didn't feel afraid anymore. I've felt a lot more comfortable hugging people since then and even made a few close relationships. \n\nShe was very ambitious with her personal business so she told me that she felt like I really respected her by spending so much time seeking out her specific kind of experience. She gave me her number and told me I could text her every now and then as a friend.\n\nI also confessed my feelings for someone the other day and I'm happy that they were validated and the person was honest in their rejection and i obviously respected them had. Now I don't feel afraid of rejection either.\n\nSince I understand my mind well enough now I seem to know what it needs to feel better",

It made me realize that I've been letting these apps prove my self worth by how many likes I get on a picture or how many retweets I get on a tweet. I know what I'm capable of in my life and I will not let these apps contradict that. If you are feeling like you are in the same position that I was in please please please watch The Social Dilemma or read Catherine Price's \"How To Break Up With Your Phone\".

        "text": "I’ve never been one for taking chances or risks. I don’t mean going skydiving or something “extreme” like that but more in terms of being okay with not feeling good. I’ve taken a lot of actions to make myself feel safe but they’ve actually kept me from reaching my full potential. I’ve had a false sense of safety because I haven’t done anything to shake the old habitual stuff in a real way, until now. \n\nTo give an example of what I mean, a situation came up yesterday that really proves I am heading into new territory and I’ll start with this for context: I can’t stand the idea of someone being mad at me. I know it roots back into my childhood, my mom was very aggressive (emotionally and mentally- never physically). She was full of rage and anger from her unhealed stuff. I can remember even when I was young that she would get mad me for doing kids stuff, and then as I got older when I was “rebellious” she really got scarily mad because I was defying what she deemed acceptable. She would lose her mind at me. Her energy is extremely harsh and I’ve been told by others it feels like daggers being thrown at you which I totally resonate with. Anytime I went out of line or anytime I was bothering her, I’d know about it on a grand scale. I learned that I was the problem. And then i learned that I was the one who had to fix it. I had to apologize or else my mom wouldn’t speak to me for days. I had to be the one to suck it up because I needed my mom, more than she needed me. So I did. And so, the habit was formed. \n\nI’ve been experiencing some parallels between my mom and a coworker. Everything is a mirror, right? So my coworker is very aggressive but has a sweet spot for me because I’m agreeable and help her (sometimes at the cost to my own inner peace and my own work). It’s been really bad while working from home.  I needed to do my own work but she was calling me incessantly over something our boss needed for a meeting in 45 minutes. This was something she told our boss she had for 2 weeks already. She doesn’t know how to use excel really and working from home she says her computer doesn’t work well for excel. I helped her and then I realized how stressed she was making me and the fact my boss told her to do it. My boss called and when she asked me what I was doing I mentioned I was assisting my coworker with the spreadsheet and my boss lost it. \nI’m done with being the person that does all the work silently. I have a million things to do for my boss and she knows that and our relationship has actually gotten better during all of this. My coworker was taking advantage of me and trying to take credit for work I did. My boss asked why i was doing it because she told my coworker it was her responsibility. I told her that i was told it was a priority and very important that it’s finished quickly. My boss then called my coworker freaking out. Coworker then reached out to me to ask me to send her everything I had done and she had to finish the rest herself. \n\n30 minutes later my coworker reached out asking for me to help with something else “when i had a chance”. I couldn’t believe it! I didn’t answer the email because I was busy and didn’t have any “chances”. I have to stick up for me. \n\nThe next day came and I was getting aggressively written emails from my coworker. I had an idea: I would call her to make amends! To apologize for not answering! To see if she was okay. And then I stopped myself, “why am I so uncomfortable with the idea someone could not like me in this moment? Why do I need to fix everything?” And then my mom came to mind. \n\nMe sitting for hours with the feeling my coworker could be mad at me was really uncomfortable. But I didn’t try to fix it because I realized I did nothing wrong. That is a big step in the right direction for me: not bridging myself on top of a puddle so others can cross on top of me. I’m so used to being the one who gives in. Not doing so made me really uncomfortable. But I can be uncomfortable and still not act on every urge just bc it’s uneasy for me to sit with it. It’s ok to feel weird about a situation because you’re not doing what you usually do, which in my case was self-sabotaging just to make sure someone else was ok with me. \n\nWhat someone else thinks of me in any given moment really isn’t my business. I have to stay true to me and follow the path of growth instead of the one that leads me to places I’ve gone before.",

        "text": "&#x200B;\n\nPeople go through experiences that truly traumatize them. Horrifying experiences. Unfair experiences. They get molested growing up. They see their parent die in an accident. They get beat up and robbed by a gang. They get cheated on by the love of their life.\n\nAnd these experiences are legitimate reasons to feel unwell. They are circumstances that affect you in ways that sometimes only a professional can solve.\n\nBut most experiences are not that traumatic. Maybe one day you miss the bus to work. Maybe you drop your ice cream in the sand at the beach on a holiday trip to Mexico.\n\nYou still have a job. You still keep going on holidays.\n\nThis is not a post on being happy with what you have though.\n\n**In the absence of traumatic events in your life, your daily mood is mostly effected by your current health.**\n\nSo fix your health first.\n\nHere are the four areas of health that is probably good to check if something feels wrong. If any of these are neglected, it's probably good to take care of that *before* coming to any conclusions.\n\n## Sleep\n\nThis is the most important health factor. If you haven’t had a proper night’s sleep, you won’t function well. Period. Your mood will suffer. Your energy levels will be under par. Your mind won’t be as clear, and you won’t be able to process thoughts as well.\n\nThis means that if something slightly bad happens, the probability of you reacting badly will increase tenfold.\n\nSo do your best to make sure you sleep long enough, and effective enough. If you know you’re not taking care of your sleep, take the necessary actions to improve it.\n\n## Exercise\n\nThere are enough posts and articles out there on why exercise improves your mood. I would say these reasons are in short why I’m including this as an important factor to fitness of handling life:\n\n1. You will have the strength and endurance to handle obstacles **physically**.\n2. You will be able to get enough energy to your mind to handle them **mentally**.\n3. Our bodies are wired to hunt and run away from predators. If we don’t use them properly we will become restless and react to trivial matters more dramatically.\n4. You be sick less, and when you’re not sick, you will have an easier time handling what life throws at you.\n5. You’ll start viewing previously negative events as neutral (and sometimes even positive). Like having to get up to get the remote. Carrying groceries home. Helping someone move.\n6. The chemistry in your body will change completely, which results in more positive emotions in general.\n\n## Diet\n\nEating well helps out with all of the above as well. Some foods make you lethargic. Some foods make you hungrier. Sugary foods result in cravings that can make you a very hard person to be around.\n\nMake sure that the stuff you put in your body is the right stuff, and you will be fit to handle more of the lemons that life give you.\n\n## Meditation\n\nOur society is structured to always try to steal our attention, to always make us want more and to not be happy with what we have.\n\nMeditation helps to make you realize that no matter what happens, all you have is the present moment. And in the present moment you can always choose to be happy. The present moment is often a happy place too, unless you are burning alive or currently witnessing someone being stabbed to death.\n\nThere are many physical changes that come from meditation too, which will surely help you on your way. But I personally think that it's hard to describe/know what meditation actually does to you, unless you try it for a while. I didn't realize the benefits until a couple of months doing it (I just kept on with it because I wanted to be a person who meditated). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo every time you are feeling cranky, feeling sorry for yourself, feeling that life is unfair — make sure that you have these 4 areas responsible for your health in check. Reassess afterward, and conclude that life is pretty good after all.",

        "title": "Here are 18 ways to manage your misery.",
        "text": "Sometimes stuff just piles up on us. Work, friends, family, financial issues, bad habits and addictions.. The list goes on.\n\nYou may feel like you were doing so fine, but now, suddenly you're going in the wrong direction, slipping back into old habits. You start coping with the stress in your life in ways you know aren't healthy. You start losing focus (or focusing on the wrong stuff), you may feel downright depressed, and it's like you're stuck in a loop of despair.\n\nHere are 18 things you can do to get back on track.\n\n1. This one should be obvious. Cut down on stimulants. And I'm not just talking about coffee and adderall, I'm also talking about loud EDM music, sugar, jerking off, fast food and other pleasurable stuff. Does this mean you can't do your regular evening fap or blast music at the gym? No, but you do need to cut back on it as much as possible. Give your little brain a break.\n\n2. Write a list. There are probably 1000 things running through your mind lately. But I'm willing to bet you'll only be able to write down 10-ish things. The stress we feel can amplify our brains to-do list. If you have 5 big problems, your brain may subconsciously think of them as 50 medium sized problems, which is even worse. So, write them down and sort them in a hierarchy of priorities. Focus on one thing at a time.  \n\n3. Nutrition. Make sure you eat enough food, with emphasis on enough. It doesn't need to be the cringey clean eating super ultra mega healthy stuff you see on IG reels. Pasta, bread and cereal are not all that bad. Relax. \n\n4. Sleep. This is probably the most important one. You'll be a wreck if you consistently sleep too little, it's really really bad. As for waking up, I recommend getting a strong, full spectrum lamp that you plug into a timer that matches your desired sleep schedule. Set your alarm clock a little bit after the light switches back on. My lamp is so strong that I almost get blinded and I'm basically forced to get out of bed. In my case, it also functions as a grow light for my plants :)\n\n5. Exercise. I think so many of you overestimate this one quite honestly. You do not need to hit the gym 5x a week unless you're looking to build muscle. The only thing you really need is to get that body moving. Get up from the couch, go for daily walks, hit the gym maybe twice a week or whatever works for you. Or do home workouts, those are really effective aswell. Making this a habit will improve your life so much. Tust me. Just trust me bro.\n\n6. Reset days. Depending on your schedule, plan one day each week to meal prep, do laundry, clean and organize the physical space around you. Again, make a list of what's most important here. In my opinion, meal prepping and doing the laundry is by far most important, screw cleaning. (but no, you should still clean).\n\n7. Vent to someone. This could be to a friend, family member, therapist or here on reddit. Getting stuff out of your system is extremely important. The thing is, if you're a loner like me, your thoughts rarely get spoken, so they end up stuck inside your head. The true benefit of ventilating is that spoken words mean more action. Thoughts will only become true if they're either written or spoken. The only way for stress to truly dissapear is through your mouth (and I really believe that one). \n\n8. Hobbies. Don't rush it though. If you really have a million things to do, then fine, I get it. You may actually not have time for this. But it doesn't have to be that much of a project either. Just pick a pen and paper and start doodling something. Maybe plant a seed and wait for it to sprout? Just do something calming, something easy. Whatever and whenever you want.\n\n9. Meditate. I don't really do this, and I don't know much about it. But I know it's very effective, because I tried it a couple years back but just couldn't stick to it. Basically it feels like purifying your entire soul. Like cleaning out the garbage you're carrying around all day. It feels fucking amazing if you manage to get the hang of it. But it's difficult.\n\n10. Think simpler. I believe this one touches on stoicism but I'm not sure. Basically, recognize what you can and cannot control. If there's something bad that's going to happen and you know you can't avoid it, you just need to surrender. But for the stuff you CAN control, go do something about it. The point here is to simplify your thinking into kind of a computer (If that, then that) and also to find comfort in your decisionmaking.\n\n11. Cry. Think about something that triggers your true feelings. Whether it be positive or negative, doesn't matter. It may feel counter productive, like \"isn't the point here to make myself feel good not sad?\" but allowing yourself to cry about your fucked up life can seriously relieve stress. Try listening to the saddest, yet most calming song you can imagine, and flip through your childhood photos. You'll cry.\n\n12. Stop partying completely. For a while. Because it's just not good for you during stressful times, and you know it. Focus on yourself instead.\n\n13. Stay disciplined. Look back at your past, things have almost always turned out OK right? I mean for some people life will always be miserable due to bad luck, there's no getting around that. But for most of you, I bet you have some sort of track record of success. You need to trust that success will happen again. You got the evidence right there, what makes things so impossible right now if you've gone through similar (or worse) stuff before?\n\n14. Allow yourself to be a mess. You can't mask all the time, you can't hide forever. People will notice you're not as happy as you used to be. Let them notice. Stay true to yourself always. \n\n15. Drink water. Some of us go around dehydrated every day wondering what makes us feel so weird. It could be a lack of water, so just try drinking some more. But not too much!\n\n16. Write a story. Are you feeling lonely and sexually frustrated? Try writing romantic erotica. Feeling angry and aggressive? Write horror, thriller or fighting stories. Feeling anxious? Write calm joyful stories. But the important part is that they have to end in a good way. Don't just write miserable stuff and stop halfway through. Develop your characters and give them an objective, then make sure they get that W.\n\n17. Looksmaxx. It's so fucking simple. Get frequent haircuts, groom your beard (if you have one), take care of your skin and body, brush teeth, and get some nice clothes. Not only will this make you more attractive, it'll also make people treat you better, and you'll feel more confident. Bonus points if you manage to make this an actual routine.\n\n18. Cut out the negativity. You may think you have a thick skin, or you're too tough to be offended. But that's never true. You're human, you're more vulnerable than you think you are. So cut out anyone who's purely toxic. It's going to be extremely difficult but such a relief if you manage to get them out of your life.\n\n\nAnyways, that's all I could think of right now. This took like one hour to write to I really hope I'll be able to help someone. Remember, these things can be used short term and long term. You don't necessarily have to stick to things forever, sometimes it's all about coping right here and right now.\n\nI wish you all a great day! You're amazing.",

        "title": "Pretend you’re in a movie to be your true self and be happy. Gain confidence.",
        "text": "Tl,dr: act like you are in a movie as the main character. Be confident and positive. Just do it. YOU ARE POWERFUL AND HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AND WE LOVE YOU. Don’t give a fuck about what people think. You are badass. People will gravitate towards you and want to be your friend if you be yourself and make their lives exciting.\n\nI’ve come to realise a lot of people’s issues are caused by lack of confidence and worrying about how their life may not seem as cool or social as other people’s. I went through a bad patch a couple of years ago; I was a typical bottom of the pecking order bullied girl in high school. But things have definitely improved since then and it’s ALL ABOUT OUTLOOK. I wanted confidence- I gave it to myself. Everything dramatically improves from there like a domino effect. That shit’s powerful. Like I mean EVERYTHING comes together. I started realising that I’m not actually fat and never have been- we should worship our bodies as long as they are healthy. I started making more friends. I started being way happier. My general life success increased. Just everything got better. Gaining confidence may seem like a difficult task and it sure is. The hike is hard initially but then it’s practically exponential growth. It may seem weird if one day you suddenly become your true badass self but who cares what others think? You only live once- there is no time to dilly dally about starting your REFRESHED LIFE. Whatever deity you believe in- they’d be proud of you. Yall have probably heard this all before but the way I did it was to simply not give a fuck about what people think about me. Simple as. It’s also great to treat your life like a movie: romanticise all the bad things, live in the moment, do the crazy things you want to do, be spontaneous, be up for anything, shoot those shots (metaphorical pls unless it’s a ball game)! Do whatever makes you happy (lmao providing it doesn’t hurt other people)- there might sometimes be consequences but happiness is priceless and the personal growth you gain makes everything a net gain. Along with all this come friends. Although you soon start to realise you don’t need to please people and sometimes particular humans simply don’t connect on a spiritual level so you don’t pine for more friendships, you will probably start to notice more people wanting to become YOUR FRIEND because that’s how confidence works. Think of what makes you want to be someone’s friend. Many answers might be: they are confident, they are positive, they inspire you, they are exciting to be around, they are kind, they are funny and they make your life better. So much of this comes as a result of confidence from within. For example, you become more funny if you are confident enough to say those risky jokes in your head and speak your mind. \n\nJust do it my bros. Flick the switch. Don’t care what people think. Speak your mind, do what you want. When you walk in a room, be the main character. Strut hard, speak loud, greet people and get them to involve you in the conversation. People will find this odd but I’m sure deep down they’ll just be jealous of you. Don’t waste your precious life trying to please people, seem cool or fit in. People love badasses, that’s why there are so many films about them. Be a badass. People will be absolutely drawn to you. \n\nA few examples of people who inspire me and make me realise my personality is fly (cos they seem similar to me) are Pewdiepie, lazarbeam, Ironman, donkey from shrek, captain Jack sparrow, rebel Wilson, princess Diana (may she rest in peace) etc. These people may not work in inspiring you too but make sure you surround yourself with media of people who make you smile, appreciate life and make you want to be like them. Don’t bother with people who make you feel bad- those relationships are always mutually damaging.\n\nPs I’m so sorry if I’ve come across as super cocky in this post or a bit hippie (ironic, I know, considering I’ve said I don’t care what yall think). I’ve written ridiculously much so thank you for getting to the end 😂 but I hope this at least helps one person a bit. BE WHO YOU WANNA BE, life’s too short. YOU ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER. I love you!\n\nEdit: some grammar",

        "text": "Men who struggle with women almost always have a mindset of self-victimization. They believe that their unattractive qualities are static, and that women are a monolithic group that have somehow deemed them unworthy. \n\nWhen I was unsuccessful, I had the same mindset as well. It wasn’t until I took ownership of my situation, and realized that there were things about myself that I needed to change, that things began improving. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s also freeing. You realize you have control over most aspects of your life. \n\n- “I’m ugly.” There is a difference between being physically attractive and naturally good looking. Being physically attractive involves being in shape, wearing clothes that fit, having good posture and body language, being well groomed. Being physically attractive, which you have control over, is more important than being naturally good looking.\n\n- “I’m short.” There are some women who put emphasis on height, and there’s nothing you can do about that. Move on. You see short guys with beautiful women all the time. The height requirement is usually a fabrication of the online dating world. A gregarious personality and confidence is far more powerful than height. \n\n- “I’m shy.” This isn’t a static quality. Being introverted and shy aren’t one in the same. It’s extremely uncomfortable, but you have to ask yourself if you really want to change. Being shy is the single biggest inhibitor to social success. If you can’t function socially, you should pursue therapy, or even medication if a mental health professional feels it’s necessary.\n\n- “I’m boring.” This is on you. You likely aren’t boring, you are just afraid to be vulnerable and show people who you are. This is normal; it’s difficult to share ourselves with others, and face rejection.  If you don’t feel like you have a dynamic personality, or have much to talk about, you need to expand your horizons. Find a hobby you’re passionate about, read more, go out and try things you’ve been hesitant to pursue.\n\nBottom line is, you have to put yourself out there. You have to experience getting rejected, and having success as well. Until you’re willing to experience these type of emotions, things won’t change. No more excuses.\n\nEdit: This isn’t meant to bash men, or excuse bad behavior from certain women. Nor is it meant to be callous towards men who are struggling. I’ve been there. It’s meant to point out that a lot of things in life aren’t static and you have control.",

I’m in a club and chat with the other people every time but I never do anything with them outside of the club and I don’t know how that happens. I assume I need to suggest something but when would that be appropriate? What should I suggest? etc\n\nOther than not knowing what to do, I don’t think there’s actually anything wrong with me. I’m happy with how I look, the few friends that I have managed to make (due to those limited situations where I do know what to do) seem to enjoy spending time with me so I think I have an ok personality. It’s not even being shy either. I really enjoy talking and spending time with people. I am just really bad at getting things started and the unfortunate thing about being a guy is that it’s entirely on me to do that.\n\nAll I can do is keep trying to figure things out. Every day I think to myself, what experiment can I try today. I have been very slowly figuring things out but it’s very difficult. 99% of the things I try don’t work at all and most of the things that do don’t go anywhere."

        "text": " I thought if I did enough self improvement I would be happy. I thought that losing the weight, learning to beat procrastination, and practicing happiness affirmations would make me a content human being.\n\nBut my self love was conditional. I felt good when I made progress on my goals. It was great when I applied what I learned. But there are always setbacks.\n\nAnd when you love yourself conditionally those setbacks are cause for brutal self evisceration. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>“Why can’t I do anything right? Why do I fail at so many things when I know exactly what I should do? How am I still such a failure even after reading all these books?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the self improvement books I was reading. Setbacks are normal, but if you lambast yourself for every misstep then you won’t stay on the horse long enough to get where you want to go.\n\nI would try to learn a new skill. I’d make a little progress. Fall off the horse. Hate myself. Pick a new skill. Repeat.\n\nI chased my tail in this circle for years before I found a way out, and I really hope one person reading this can learn from my mistakes.\n\nYou can not make real progress towards a better you when the voice track in your head is full of malice 24 hours a day. You can’t stand up straight and learn to think positively while you’re also whipping and screaming at yourself constantly on the inside.\n\nThese words from a talented therapist helped me realize what was missing, speaking about losing my father at a young age:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>“You had to be your own father. You learned how to set high expectations for yourself, how to discipline yourself, but you never learned how to give yourself love and support. A good father doesn’t just punish, he helps you through hard times and picks you back up when you fall down. It’s just as important to be the supportive side of a father for yourself as it is to be the strict side.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had been working so hard and setting such high expectations and getting so angry with myself. I had been exactly that, an angry father. But I had never been the compassionate dad. I had never held out a hand to myself when things went to hell. I just yelled at myself louder.\n\n*Please, please, please* consider prioritizing self compassion in your personal development. Reading Self Compassion by Kristen Neff changed everything for me because setbacks no longer meant I was a failure. It meant I was a human, I was able to dust myself off and soothe myself. I was able to express and really feel the pain and disappointment without getting angry with myself. I can finally grow into who I want to be because my self talk has changed from furious, venomous coach to compassionate, caring friend.\n\nDon’t take this as me saying self improvement is bad. Personal development is a huge part of my life and will continue to be for as long as I live. But if you relate to the negative feedback cycles described above then I want you to consider working on self compassion before you pick up your next PD book.  \n\nWant to grow? To maximize your potential? **You’ll go so much farther when YOU are always on YOUR team, not fighting against and attacking yourself.**\n\nStop dragging yourself through hell. You deserve better than that.",

        "text": "Going to Rehab is the best thing I've ever done for myself. 26 days clean of cocaine, adderall, benzos and alcohol!!!\n\nOne month ago I was as close to death as I ever have been. I'm 22 years old and I was a skeleton of myself. I looked atrocious, I was suicidal, underweight, dabbling in every drug except heroin with a severe addiction to cocaine, adderall, benzos and alcohol. I would start my day with a beer and Baley's Irish Cream to deal with the comedown from cocaine and adderall the night before. I had no sleep schedule and I was accomplishing absolutely nothing. My rock bottom was when I kicked my Mom's new car twice as hard as I coud out of anger, putting 400$ worth of damage onto it. From that scene I was left to walk home 5 miles in an unfamiliar neighborhood with no friends to pick me up because I had either lost them all for the friends I thought I had were actually scumbags and dealers. I decidedc then that I was done and the next morning I called a rehab to voluntarily check myself in for a 30 day program. \n\nRehab has been the best decision I've ever made. They feed us amazingly, detox you under medical supervision, make sure you're comfortable in every way. This rehab is basically a country club for people that have been fucked up - it is a former hotel converted into a treatment center. The people are amazing and I've learned so much from every single one of them. All of the employees are recovering addicts so they understand and want to help. I see a therapist 3 times a week, psychiatrist 1-3 times a week, and have cass on coping and life skills 6 hours a day 6 days a week. \n\nI feel like a completely new person both physically and mentaly. I haven't done this well since I was 16 years old running cross country before I even smoked weed. My bipolar disorder is under control, I feel no depression, minimal anxiety, minimal mania. I'm waking up at 5:00 AM every day and reading, exercising, writing lists of what I'm grateful for and eating better than I ever have. In this month I've gone from underweight to a normal weight (10 pounds ater). I look completely different and people are shocked to see my before photo. Since I've been writing this, two people have come to say good morning to me, and yesterday I had a very successful businessman offer to be my life mentor. I have an internship lined up on a political campaign when I'm out of here that I got through my roommate I had when I first arrived. I've applied to 6 jobs in the last week.

Take a minute and respect that. Respect where you are, respect your own awareness, and respect that you’re working toward your goals. Don’t rush, be patient, and trust the process.

They crave validation.\n\nMen with internal power live freely, regardless of the expectations of others. They are who they are, and aren’t concerned with how they’ve perceived.\n\nThey also aren’t afraid to be kind (not nice). They aren’t as self-focused, so they like to see others succeed. Often, those who subscribe to alpha male concept, have a false sense of bravado, and try to act domineering. They put others down to preserve an image of power. However, when they are confronted, they almost always fold.\n\nIf you thrive to be independent, self-assured, and centered emotionally, things will fall into place. \n\nWorrying about the perception of others and overcompensating by putting on a false front is the behavior of a truly weak man.",

        "title": "Completely changed my life within 4 months. This is how it happened.",
        "text": "**My Breakup Story**\n\n\"Beginnings always hide themselves in ends” - Mike Posner\n\nI’m 25 years old, and this is my insane story of the last four months.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, I ended a nearly six-year relationship. The initial month proved to be the most challenging, given my unfamiliarity with single life. Overwhelmed by the fear of perpetual solitude or not finding someone as \"good\" as my ex, I recognized fear as a significant motivator in my life decisions. This fear pushed me to self-improvement. Critically assessing myself, I identified areas under my control for enhancement. Addressing issues like bad skin through a dermatologist, improving my haircut at the best barber available, and addressing my physique by hitting the gym collectively boosted my confidence significantly.\n\nFeeling more confident in my appearance, I shifted focus to refining my social skills. Despite being naturally introverted, I acknowledged the necessity of change. Realizing I wouldn't find the love of my life sitting at home, I began frequenting bars on Friday and Saturday nights with the goal of striking up conversations with strangers. Eventually bumping into and reconnecting with old high school friends, we started hanging out consistently, re-establishing a small social circle. Through these interactions, I transformed into more of an extrovert. This eventually led to me briefly dating someone in October, I quickly realized I wasn't over my ex, leading to the decision to end the relationship. Nonetheless, the experience illustrated what it feels like to be treated well, affirming to myself that I am worthy of dating and that I will eventually find the right partner.\n\nContinuing my efforts to socialize and improve myself, I came across a couple of gentleman sitting at the bar talking business, so I chimed in on their conversation. After a brief chat with them, they invited me to a chamber of commerce meeting that was being held the following evening. At the meeting I formed connections with a bunch of professionals in a wide range of different industries. This taught me the value of networking, I started to see positive changes in my career prospects by frequently staying in touch with these new contacts.\n\nBy the end of November, I had dated a few girls, formed new connections, and expanded my professional network. However, still not over my ex, I felt the need for a fresh start. Considering my parents' upcoming move to a location I disliked, I researched areas better suited to my lifestyle. St. Petersburg, FL, caught my interest, prompting me to impulsively book a one-week trip. I was anxious about the idea of solo travel and being completely alone on a “vacation”, so I joined a Facebook group for twenty-somethings who recently moved there. I made a post introducing myself and ended up hanging out and partying with a bunch of strangers. By the end of the trip I had an entire new friend group. I encountered a girl during my trip who was also traveling solo and coincidentally lived just 20 minutes away from me back home. After the trip, we continued spending time together, and last week, we even went on a skiing trip. I also met with another girl during that time, and we play online games together. We're making plans to hangout during my upcoming trip.\n\nDespite wanting to settle in the new city, my small business lacked the financial means to support such a move. Leveraging my new professional network, I reached out to inquire about remote job opportunities. Fortunately, someone I had met offered a lead, resulting in a remote job with a six-figure salary. This newfound stability and income will allow me to relocate to this new city in a few months after I save a bit of money.\n\nIn under four months, my life made a complete 180-degree turn. Prior to the breakup, I lacked friends, self-esteem, motivation, and experienced frequent depression. Now, I find myself in a place I never thought possible in such a short time – surrounded by new friends, a fulfilling career, and a renewed sense of self.\n\n**Things that helped guide me**\n\nOne thing that helped me significantly was a podcast featuring Lex Fridman and Matthew McConaughey. In the podcast, McConaughey delves into the concept of \"Mythical Opportunities\" – occurrences or events that spontaneously happen and cannot be recreated or manufactured. These are situations that the universe presents if you remain open to catching them.\n\nAdditionally, another valuable insight came from a person I met at a chamber of commerce meeting, a highly successful individual who shared that his favorite movie was \"Yes Man.\" The movie revolves around a character who embraces every opportunity that comes his way. While it's not practical to say yes to everything, being open-minded and avoiding a default \"no\" attitude can lead to unexpected experiences. Embrace the journey without expectations and see where it takes you. Forcing things doesn't yield positive outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI chose to write this with the hope of inspiring someone. I want to express my sincere apologies if it comes across as self-promotion. Reflecting on my own experiences, I believe that encountering a similar message in the past would have motivated me to initiate positive changes.\n\nIn a nutshell, my elevator pitch would revolve around the idea of \"knowing what you want, cultivating your best self, embracing an open-minded approach, and navigating life with a sense of trust in the universe.\"",

I would always complain at the end of the day of how bad my day and life was.\n\nBut after reading a certain Manga, I decided to try and change my perspective and it was a very super different feeling.\n\nI started trying out things I thought I will never do such as listen to popular music, read and finish a book, look at the positives in life, even try posting in reddit. I didn't notice it at first but after a while, I noticed that I was actually happy for a few weeks straight. Weeks became months then eventually turned to a year. \n\nFor the first time in my life, I felt motivated and inspired to keep living even if it's difficult most of the time. And it's all because I tried to be positive for at least one day, no matter how bad it was going to be.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share it and I hope everyone in this subreddit will also feel this way. It's an awesome feeling and it's very very addictive (in my opinion).\n\nEdit: The manga is titled \"Eyeshield 21\" if you're curious.",

I enrolled back in college after dropping out 3x and recently finished the semester with a 4.0. I quit my toxic 9-5 job and became an independent contractor. \n\nI finally took my life into my own hands. it’s ironic that it happened after the hardest thing i’ve ever gone though, losing my long term partner. but it made me realize how short life can be and I don’t want to waste a single second being unhappy. \n\nthanks OP for sharing your story! sending love & positive vibes to everyone."

        "text": "*1. Judging yourself negatively* \nHave you ever thought about why you're so much nicer to other people than you are to yourself? It's because you don't have proper boundaries with yourself, so you ALLOW yourself to walk all over you.  You would never talk to a friend the way you speak about yourself. \n\n*2. Labeling yourself awkard, boring, or weird*\nWhen you put certain labels on yourself, you're subconsciously telling your mind what is and is not possible for you. Don't label yourself in these negative ways. There's a difference between sometimes being akward and identifying as an awkward person.\n\n*3. Waiting until later to start working on your social skills*\nThey're not going to fix themselves. I wish they would. MAYBE making more money, getting in better shape, moving to a new location would make you feel more confident which would, in turn, make you more at ease in social situations. But in many cases, it won't bring you the results in your social life you want. So honestly, the risk is too great; your social life is too important. Improve these skills AS your working on the other areas of your life.\n\n*4. Studying more about your problem*\nLook, you probably don't need to know more about your problem. You don't need to know everything about weeds in order to pull them out of your garden. The more you focus on your problems, the more real they become in your mind. Focus more on SOLUTIONS. Focus on the POSITIVE OUTCOME. Don't give the negative thoughts power by feeding them.\n\nIf you'd like help addressing something more specific in your social life, feel free to reach out. I'm aware these struggles in our social life are easy to talk about, but can be difficult to solve. So I try my best to be a positive influence for anyone who might feel lost.",

Using common sense and a drive to keep going, I lost weight without having to cardio. \n\nJust a few months after I got my gym membership, I went from the fattest I've ever been to the best shape I've ever been in. If you haven't given exercise a shot, PLEASE, just try it, once. It'll be hard at first. But once you start to see those results and see yourself getting stronger, you'll feel like the king of the world.\n\nPlease give working out a shot. It'll be the best thing that ever happened to you, too.",

I feel so healthier and fitter already, I’m so thankful and it makes me want to treat my body to good healthy food, to not overeat etc...\nI also fall in love with the feeling of laying in bed before sleep after a workout&shower, the slight pain in the muscles... oh those are definitely the happiness hormones <3\n\n[Omg I never expected so many upvotes for my sentiment, thanks guys keep rolling!!]"

        "title": "85% Of What We Worry About Never Happens",
        "text": "Before I begin, this statistic is NOT mine. 500 years ago, a man named Michel De Montaigne said “my life has been filled with terrible misfortune, most of which never happens”. There is a study that proves this. The particular study looked into how many of our imagined calamities never materialise. Within the study, participants were asked to write down their worries over an extended period of time and then they had to identify which of these “worries” did not actually happen. \n\nThe results came back and it showed that 85% of what the participants were worried about never happened. But, 15% of them did happen. 79% of the participants discovered either they could handle the difficulty better than expected or that the worry taught them a lesson worth learning. This means overall, 97% of the worry that’s flying around your head is nothing more than a fearful mind that is punishing you with exaggerations and misperceptions. \n\nMichel De Montaigne’s quote has made people laugh and joke about it for 5 decades. But, as we all know, worrying is no joke. A worried mind is a dangerous mind. A worried mind means a chronically stressed brain, and by having chronic stress it generates problems, serious problems. The stress hormones and the worry that is dumped into your system shrinks the brain mass, lowers your overall IQ, makes you prone to a heart disease and cancer, a better chance of getting depression and makes seniors more likely to develop dementia and Alzheimer’s. \n\n**The Study**\n\nResearchers at Penn State University (based in Pennsylvania) asked 29 people with GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) to write down everything that they are worried about for a whole month. The participants also recorded the outcomes of the worries they had. The researchers found that 91% of the participants worries didn’t come true. For several participants in the study, exactly 0 of the things that they worried about didn’t happen.  \n\nEven on the rare occasion that the person’s worry translate to reality and became true, the outcome of that specific worry was often better than the person feared. Not only did the worries not come true, but then presented with the evidence and results, the worries were largely unfounded, many of the participants in the study experienced improvements in their anxiety symptoms. A win-win!\n\nHere are some quotes\n\n- “Do not anticipate trouble or worry about what may never happen. Keep in the sunlight” - **Benjamin Franklin**\n- “When I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which never happened” - **Winston Churchill**\n- “If you want to test your memory, try to recall what you were worrying about one year ago today” - **E. Joseph Cossman**\n- “Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow” - **Swedish Proverb**\n- “Worry is a thin stream of fear tricking through the mind. If encouraged, it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained” - **Arthur Somers Roche**\n- “Worry is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do but it doesn’t get you anywhere” - **Unknown**\n- “People becomes attached to their burdens sometimes more than the burdens are attached to them” - **George Bernard Shaw**\n- “Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today or joy” - **Leo F. Buscaglia**\n\nThrow your worry out the window and lock it out. Instead, breathe and relax. You’ve worried enough, it’s time to give yourself some well earned time off. :)",

I slowly started changing up my inner dialogue, speaking positively to myself. I try to pretend as if when I speak to myself I am speaking to a dear friend. If I fail, or things don’t work quite as well as I wanted, I no longer beat myself up, I remind myself I’ve done my absolute best and encourage myself to be better tomorrow. No failure or mishap is the end of the world. New opportunities will always present themselves and change is a constant energy in our lives. When negative thoughts sometimes sneak in, I acknowledge them and reply “this is the old me. Now I am the opposite.” So if I call myself stupid, I reply “no, this thought is the old me. I know I am smart, I know I am capable.” And so on. When you love yourself, respect yourself, acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses(and work on improving!), many worries dissolve since lots of them are usually hovering around the sentiment we’re not good enough. \n\nI also started meditating daily. I’d recommend starting small, using short guided meditations, even 5 minutes a day. It helped me relief stress, and is also helping me slowly but surely gain control over my brains focus. Learning to set my attention to one thing at a time. Very often my mind would wander to worry no matter what I was doing, which made me way less productive and more chaotic.\nI can already notice the ease that it brought to my life, even through the whole day and not necessarily only when I’m in the act of meditating. \n\nAnd most importantly, understanding that the brain is a muscle you need to work like any other. \nYou want your mind to be stronger? Work it. Notice the patterns you feel are holding you back, or that you simply don’t like and start searching for ways to change them. It’s not always easy, but your peace of mind is such an asset to have, and it could change your life in every possible aspect, so it’s definitely worth it.\n\nChange is the only thing that stays consist all through life. Embrace that fact and always work to change for the better. \nMuch love 💜"

        "text": "Many people I meet these days who are feeling depressed or lack self-esteem tell me they want to \"find themselves\" and, honestly, I used to feel the same way. But a small realization did wonders for my self-improvement journey and I hope what I'm about to say will help some of you as well.\n\nThe problem with trying to find yourself is that it implies that there is some other version of you hiding away waiting to be found. This could mean that there is some better you hidden away or some older version of you waiting to be found.\n\nWell, there is no better version to be found because you are who you are and we don't have personalities waiting to be unlocked like a video game and the old you was the version that allowed those bad things to happen or allowed you to fall into the despair that led you here.\n\nOnce you've accepted this you can really begin improving your life. The very first thing you need to do is envision the perfect version of yourself. This version needs to be the ultimate you. Don't try to be realistic, make it as perfect as possible.\n\nThen begin analyzing it. Break down its character traits in detail and do the same for the current you. Once you know what traits the perfect version has that the current one lacks you can start working on acquiring them. Once you know what traits the current you has that the perfect one lacks you can work on overcoming them.\n\nThere is no \"finding yourself\". There is only building yourself up.\n\nI hope this helps you guys. Goodluck!\n\nEdit 1: Gonna throw in some clarification here from a reply I made to a comment. \n\nWhen I say it needs to be a \"perfect\" version I don't mean \"perfect\" from society's view. It needs to be perfect from your perspective. It's purely subjective and specific to yourself. The entire point isn't to be the best person at everything in the world. It's supposed to be the best person (character wise, career wise, socially, etc) you, as an individual, can and wish to be.",

        "text": "I'm just gonna share this qoute that I found somewhere on the internet, I usually reflect to this whenever I'm having trouble or feel exhausted about life.. it says \n\n\"Ironically enough, when you make peace with the fact that the purpose of life is not happiness, but rather experience and growth, happiness comes as a natural  byproduct. When you are not seeking it as the objective, it will find its way to you\". \n\nThis quote has elevated me through my dark times in the past. For me, the idea of seeking happiness is what makes people more depressed today, we constantly look for things that brings us joy that whenever an obstacle comes in our way we immediately think that our life is a mess. But the truth is, struggle and hardship is inevitable, it's impossible to avoid problems in life, life is unfair, it always has been, either you accept that fact or you're gonna spend your whole life stressing about why you're not happy. \n\nDon't seek happiness, just do what you have to do and stop constantly thinking about \"I need to be happy\". There is no other meaning to life other than to live it. At the end of the day it iz what it iz. Hope this helps\n(Sorry for bad english)",

I’m in the Midwest in a smaller town and public transportation is horrible. I will eventually get my license. Maybe even during this year. But then the problem is dealing with the social anxiety to get a job.\n\nI do have a therapist who is working on diagnosing me if possible but I’ve only seen her 3 times so still working on that. And after years of trying different antidepressants I am on some that actually work now but it only gets rid of the continuous thoughts of death, it doesn’t help with motivation or self esteem. As for energy I agree that eating better and moving would help. \n\nThank you for all the support. It means something that people would take time to try to help. I know there’s small improvements and habits I can make and I think a strict sleep schedule would be the first place to start. I still think I’ll be stuck at home for a while but idk I’ll keep trying to drive and work. It’s just after so long it’s easy to feel hopeless and the never ending battle with social anxiety and depression is exhausting. Anymore advice is welcomed, I basically read everything.",

As a result of not getting fresh air or sunlight for several days on end, your body may be shutting down. But, I understand being fearful of leaving the house after all of this time. So, just make small increments for now. \n\nFirst, air out your room for 30 minutes - 1 hour each day. Just open your window. Whenever sunlight comes through the window, sit somewhere where the sunlight is shining on you. Not for too long, but to feel the sun. It's more beneficial than you think. I'm assuming your Mom cooks? Tell her that you want to start prioritizing your health and that you want healthy meals. \n\nAlso, try to start just one new thing in your room. Even if it's something small, like reading a book or watching an informational video. Don't overwhelm yourself, just anything you want. But don't give in. Life isn't over."

I'm 19 and I'd dropped out of college because I wasn't interested in the subject, and I have no idea where to go next in life. And a breakup didn't help either.\n\nIf nothing, the least I can do is read and work out. I've been interested in working out/bodybuilding for 2 years now, lost a lot of weight and gained a decent amount of muscle mass in 2019 (to the point I had an average physique for my age), but since then I never managed to hold a routine for more than a month at most. As a result I didn't lose any weight, though I did gain some additional muscle mass (it could've been far better if I'd trained and eaten right consistently). This is another reason I'm feeling really down, I was stronger, more athletic and happier a year ago. I especially remember the time I did 11 chin ups about a year ago, and now I'm not even close to breaking that record.\n\nThere. My main reason for working out isn't looking good or even physical health anymore. It's just... not being depressed. It honestly feels like a better motivation. I'd like to hear your advice on sticking to a routine, both in terms of fitness and diet.\n\nNew goal: do at least 12 good form chinups",
