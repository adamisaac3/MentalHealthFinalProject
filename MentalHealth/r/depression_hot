If that doesn't work, talk to him about his deepest and darkest fears and worries about the future.\n\nThere's two ways to motivate others to move forward, you can either use the things they want to motivate them, or you can you the things they don't want as motivation. Regardless of whether he's moving forward towards something he wants or moving forwards away from something he doesn't want, he'll be moving forward and will get out of his swampy mindset eventually. \n\nYou should know something about depression: it literally makes you unable to feel positive feelings and emotions, it sucks all the hope out of the future, it makes all the bad things in the past seem worse than they are, it makes you feel like you're a cancerous tumour on the lives of others, that your existence makes everyone around you miserable. It's not a frame of mind that's easy to escape if you're following your heart and feelings, it's something you need to use your head to escape. Coaxing him into thinking about what the next move to make to progress forward in life can be done just by bringing up the subjects I mentioned at the beginning, hopes and dreams, and deepest fears. \n\nGood luck, and please don't hold it against yourself if nothing you try works. Only people who want to be helped can actually be helped, and sometimes depressed people just want to feel sad for whatever reason."

I was ashamed while I sat in the back of the cop car because I just felt like I had absolutely no control of my emotions anymore. \n\nEven though i have had many therapists, i never really got help or healed from childhood trauma. Also, my parents have a history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, anger issues. \n\nI‚Äôm going through a hard break up right now. I‚Äôll spare the details but let‚Äôs just say in terms of depression, this person ‚Äúhealed‚Äù me. When he loved me, it was like it healed a part of my inner child. We were together almost two years, i even was pregnant with his baby at some point. He recently just broke up with me and ended it for good, no closure, said the worst possible things to me to hurt me in purpose, is already moving on and sleeping with other girls. I am miserable and so hurt, I feel so alone and I have no idea how to deal with this. \n\nI have just lost hope and I feel like I will never be happy. I can‚Äôt even explain how miserable I feel. I want my life to be ended so i don‚Äôt feel like this but i don‚Äôt want to physically kill myself. \n\nI found out that I can go to the ER and have an evaluation and most likely get diagnosed/ and or prescribed something. I will probably do that after work today. I wanted to work because my coworkers feel like a family and I only work two times per week.\n\nAnother thing I will add, when i was 16 I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed prozac, it helped and for a moment of time I was overjoyed. But then the effects went down and upping my dose didn‚Äôt help. \n\nI was stupid and I stopped going to the appointments and that‚Äôs when I fell in to this relationship. \n\nThat‚Äôs why I think going to a doctor will help but I just feel so far gone because my life is completely different now. I had friends then, now i don‚Äôt. I still had motivation to get up and get ready everyday, and now i don‚Äôt. I had hope i would get better. My life was just so much better then, but I was still depressed. I was just a teenage girl who didn‚Äôt really know how life was, and now that i‚Äôm on my own I see adult life as kind of miserable and not ‚Äúexciting‚Äù like i always thought. Now my life is so lonely and I don‚Äôt know I just feel like nothings going to help. I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here. \n\nSorry that was long but thank you for reading.",

Yesterday I had to take my best self-control to not scream at my sister-in-law. She was constantly irritating and provoking her suicidal son. God I almost think she was intentionally doing that. \n\nI can't understand why some people have the fucking audacity to scream at their suicidal family with \"WHY CAN'T YOU THINK ABOUT **MY** FEELINGS FIRST?!\" Bitch, your baby boy is poisoned with Depression and is on the verge of killing himself but then you as a parent wants to prioritize *your* feelings before theirs? They can barely function and take care of themselves and you demand them to put your narcissistic ass in the 1st place??? That's not logically nor emotionally correct. \n\nAnd, OMFG, why is that a parent always fails to realize the responsibility is on them if their child is depressed? It's a parent's main fucking job to NOT get their precious baby depressed and suicidal.\n\nAlso WTF was that attitude? **ANYONE** knows you shouldn't \"motivate\" a suicidal person by stimulating or upsetting them especially in a situation like in a family gathering. What the FUCK was that woman even thinking? God I'm so pissed. \n\n I was never close to my brother and sister-in-law due to massive age gap and he was absent from the party due to him always working overseas. Therefore I couldn't say much in this matter in front of everyone. And tbh it was even my first time acknowledging that my nephew is depressed and very, very suicidal. I'm extremely angry at his parents for doing my little nephew so wrong. He was a sunny silly little turd producing machine in my memory and suddenly I almost lost him to depression... I hate myself for being so oblivious about his well-being. I feel like a fucking failure. As an experienced depression haver and bullying victim I'm currently doing my best to help my nephew. \n\nHow I wish I could strip his parents with parental rights and take him under my name. Apparently he wanted to ask help from me before but since \"being depressed is shameful\" his mother talked him into \"be quiet\" about this. Also, because I'm the \"shameless and gay\" uncle I definitely have \"a bad influence on children\" so \"you should avoid him at all cost\". Those are **all** his mother's words. Imagine my rage when I heard this from my nephew. Me or other people could've helped him and likely to avoid him becoming depressed if he wasn't taught to be quiet about it. He needed only to ask. But his own mother took that opportunity from him. I weren't even this angry when I was bullied for being gay. God I HATE narcissistic and arrogant parents like my sister-in-law. They really don't deserve to have children. \n",

As a suicidal person with no one to turn to for help, I just want to let you know that I know your nephew appreciates your help, even if you didn't help prior to finding out. As the saying goes‚Äî \"It's better to be late than never\". As long as you're supporting him and trying to help, you're not a failure. The real failure is his mother who allowed this to happen in the first place. How could she even tell her son to be quiet about it because it's shameful? How is she not embarrassed? I don't mean to disrespect any of your family members, but she honestly needs help. If she thinks that her feelings are more important than her suicidal son's then I don't even know what to say. She shouldn't have the right to be his mom or even have children in the first place with that mentality. Please don't blame yourself for not noticing earlier, it's... not easy to notice these things because of how complex humans really are. The important thing is that you're trying your best, and as I said, I'm sure your nephew appreciates it. I wish you both the best and I hope the talk with your brother goes well ‚ô° Sending you and your nephew and brother lots of wishes"

I feel like im stuck in this universe, i want an another \"everything\", because i cant accept this one. What would you do if you desired to be in that empty space (we dont know whats there, of course.) in the \"outside\" of universe? You're obligated to exist in this tiny planet's reality, and you dont know whats going on there on the other, opposite side of the universe. I dont \"believe\" in extraterrestrial life; i accept this as a real knowledge, i \"know\" it. And, its a misfortune to be only in this planet. When we die, in my belief, there is a possibility of coming back to life, but there is no possibility of coming back to this world, because of the unimaginable massiveness of the universe.\n\nYou're completely unimportant here, just as everything and everyone. No one is important, and cannot be. Because, nothing is necessary, there is no any sufficient reason for existence. But im not writing this in a dark tone, or im not definitely insulting you; im just simply writing it, because nothing matters and thus, i dont care about anything. I cant understand why people are so keen on trying to be important, and feel like they're under attack when someone tells them something like \"you dont matter.\" Being worthy and important are different things, and something worthy does not always have to be \"important\"..\n\nThey always say that we come to this world only once, and thus, we should stop our pessimism and enjoy our temporary lives. But, nothing would have happened if \"we were coming to this world only once\". I mean, that would be a source of inaction (i dont say that inaction is a \"bad\" thing, i just simply say it. But, its sad when people automatically think that i mention inaction as a \"bad\" thing..). No one would think anything, no one would invent something, and thus, this language, this screen, these words would never exist. But yeah, that doesnt matter also..\n\nMost people are unaware of those free spirits who smooths every mark made by their foot on the sand, who carefully destroys every footprint they leave while walking in places which no one visits, who makes every effort to avoid being discovered, being revaled. Being anonymous means freedom, too much freedom. \"No any\" celebrity is free, \"all of them\" are  bound by invisible chains. And, unfortunately, only a few can see these chains. The ordinary rest, insistently continues to envy these celebrities...\n\nI just wanted to express myself, and how you interpret these is entirely up to yourself..."

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs caused by the antibiotics I‚Äôm on for my current sinus infection or natural from the state of my life and quality of living. It could be a combination of both. My life is pretty shitty so that would be enough.\n\nThe way is shut and the depressed keep it. (Lotr fans know)\n\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live this life anymore. Is this life worth living. This hollow shell of a life I once had. The dreams of who I hoped to be and who I was taunting me. I fear I will never go back to who I was. In a way that is good because it is progress. Progress is never going backwards. But I want to go backwards. I would relive everything I had experienced if that is all I have left. Anything to get out of this nightmare brought to life. I have no purpose. Nowhere to be or accomplish. Why do I exist if I can‚Äôt be a part of the world. I would happily sludge through life and its stipulates if that meant I could have a life again. Wasting away at home is no life. I don‚Äôt want to be pitied. I want to feel life again. To love and be loved. To live and die. All the bad for the good. At least there‚Äôs good. A light. My mind is dark. The light is extinguished. I feel as though there is no way to light it ever again. A mine filled with entities of lost causes and dreams. Trapped in the doom of the darkness. Unable to get out. The way is shut. \n\nMy strength to fight is gone. One can only hold out for hope so long. Empty promises and a bleak future. That‚Äôs all I see. And I grow weary of trying to see more. The days are long and others complain they are too short. I feel ungrateful but if they were in my shoes they would too. I know I am strong but I do not feel strong. The only resistance I have is continuing on. Continuing to live despite not wanting to exist. My existence is resistance. But why doesn‚Äôt it feel like it. It feels like I‚Äôve given up. Given up on living. Given up on everything that is good. The love, passion, compassion, sympathy and empathy that fills the darkness with light. I do not feel it. I feel nothing. Nothing but anger and emptiness. The way is shut. And I don‚Äôt know how to open it.‚Äù",

        "text": "This is my first reddit post, ever, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm even doing. I'm just miserable. I have been, for as long as I can remember. I've always had this feeling that life is just not meant for me, I'm not equipped to handle it, at all. I've felt this way since childhood. I'm alive primarily because I don't want to put my parents or my dog through that heartache, but, my parents are getting older and my dog won't be around forever either and once they're gone, I will officially have nothing. No reason to stay. Nobody that cares about me. Life will finally be completely and utterly meaningless. I'm 22, I still live with my mom, and I can't fathom living on my own. I am already overwhelmed and drowning in the stress of life, any additional responsibilities or things to worry about would surely send me over the edge. There is too much to worry about, too much to keep track of, everything is too expensive, working sucks, if you make any mistakes you could be fucked over severely, I can't afford anything, I don't know how to do so many vital things and I have nobody to show me or help me, I have no support system. I've been in therapy for over a decade now, I've tried various therapies, various coping skills, various medications, nothing makes it better.\n\nI see so many people that have supportive, stable families, they have loving partners and friends, they're financially well off and they're figuring life out, and they have so much support that when these particularly horrible shitty confusing parts of life happen, they get through it. I wish I had that. I wish I could just be normal, not be consumed by depression all the damn time. \n\nI have fundamentally felt like I do not belong in this world ever since I was a kid. Like I just am not meant to be here, never was, and never will be. \n\nI can't change the inevitables in life. One day my parents will die. One day I will be alone, and the only people who truly unconditionally love and care about me will be gone. One day I will have no choice but to figure shit out, take on all these responsibilities I already know I can't handle and don't know how to navigate. I'm trying, I really am, I'm trying to prepare myself and figure things out while I do have some foundational stability, but I can't handle the stress. I'm so overwhelmed and it's only going to get worse so what's the point, really? I feel like once my dog and my parents are gone, my only choice will be to just take myself out with them. And that thought in itself is incredibly depressing. I'm just waiting to die, wishing I'd had the courage to get it done and over with when I was a teenager instead. I'm not glad I survived, I wish I was never born. I'm scared. And I don't know what to do.\n\n\n\n I don't want to die, the thought that my only true way to achieve peace is through dying is terrifying. But I also don't want to live. It's too hard. I don't have friends, or a big family I'm close to and that I can lean on. I'm too aware that life just really, really sucks. The good will never outweigh the bad. I'm always going to feel this way, because I always have felt this way. I am not meant to survive, and I can't just force myself through anyways. I have no purpose. I'm just here to suffer. I'm so unbelievably tired. ",

So being in a relationship does not always mean something positive... it can be torture too. When looking at statistics in the west divorces are at 40%. 10% should probably break up but don't...so 50/50. Of course feeling loved is important but it can also fall apart.

I stayed in a hospital room with his dying comatose father for days, helped him make funeral arrangements after, stuck by him through a DUI, I cleaned his house and cooked his meals, I stuck by him through some incredibly difficult times, I also took him back after he got cold feet once, funnily enough due to not being so far in and invested I actually accepted that with some tears but a determination to just move on, until he changed his mind. Overall the most I did was put my life on hold for him, sacrificing my best years, the years that should have been spent building a life for myself.\n- I (with him talking in my ear) didn‚Äôt really build a life for myself while in my own country, didn‚Äôt hold a stable job for long because I knew I‚Äôd be travelling for a long time soon anyway, and I let him convince me nothing really mattered because I was moving countries to be with him soon anyway and I could get a job I liked over there \n- covid hits and massively delays the process as well as us being able to see each other \n- we carry on with the fianc√© visa regardless, see each other once travel restrictions end\n- shortly after getting home from my last visit he dumps me and blocks me on everything \n- I mentally breakdown to the point I‚Äôm nearly hospitalised \n- never healed, still mentally ill, unable to be in a relationship, also left with a broken down life and no direction, no friends as I lost them from all the time away\n- exactly 2 years later I check his Facebook and discovered he got married exactly a year after dumping me \n- this revelation caused me to have a fresh mental breakdown and erased the little healing I‚Äôd done \n- he is married with a nice house and a dog and his nice little wife meanwhile I just cry and drink, time isn‚Äôt healing I feel worse as time passes, I‚Äôve also developed a bad case of alcoholism since he dumped me albeit functioning\n- the girl he is married to I realised I had seen the name pop on his phone on a few occasions, from the start of the relationships, but as it was a unisex name I brushed it off.\n- also began to recollect and realised signs of cheating were probably there\n- I‚Äôm achingly profoundly lonely and every attempt at dating ends in ghosting or them pumping and dumping me, the pain builds up and makes me feel like I can‚Äôt bear to be alive. I am actually suicidal and haven‚Äôt been in a good place since he broke up with me nearly 3 years ago. I‚Äôll be 27 next year. Shitty job, no friends, a strong desire to fix my life but never quite managing, therapy didn‚Äôt help, hugely hugely regretful that I met him and wasted so much time on him and I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôll probably end up old and alone.\n- I‚Äôve tried everything. What else shall I try keeping in mind I‚Äôm quite socially isolated and probably won‚Äôt love again?",

                "body": "Hey there poggusfrogus. I just wanna say first that at 16 you're very young and have lots of years to figure things out and find your place. At this age people are often much less stable and more prone to feelings of disaster when things don't go as one had hoped. But trust me, you have plenty of time and there will be lots of opportunities for you. You just need to get started, and you could start out small with doing things at home that require effort.\n\nWhen we become less active, our energy levels tend to go down and everything can seem harder to do. If we start being more active, energy levels tend to go up. For example, I (and others I spoke to) found that exercise like running makes everything feel easier once you've gotten into the habit of it, because it's tough while you do it, and so your body and mind get used to dealing with uncomfortableness.\n\nI would suggest you make a list of a few things you would like to try, and then write down the pros and cons for each one.\n\nFor example you could try to learn to cook a new dish at home. Good, tasty and nutritious food (I suggest something with some vegetables in it) can help with energy levels and be a motivation for pushing through things that are tough, like going to the gym or some other demanding task.  \nHealthy food can also help against symptoms from ADHD.\n\nIf you are a kind and trustworthy person, then there will be people who want you as their friend, and again you have lots of time to find your place and figure out what you wanna do with your time. You just need to get started with what you can muster now and then build on gradually from there.  \nYou could maybe take 20 or 30 minutes every day where you focus on figuring out what you wanna start with.\n\nI hope this helps"

Me (24F) and now ex fiance (28M) ended things on thanksgiving (bad way). \n\nEssentially, he has put his hands on me more than 5 times in the span of 6 months? The first two resulted in full body bruises and a bruised face, which I had to hide for 3 weeks. In this time span, my mom found out and ended up calling the cops on him. I defended him when I was being interrogated and LIED on his behalf because I was scared he would get in trouble. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me but I feel such an innate desire to protect him even if he hurts me‚Ä¶ I forgive everything‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm starting to realize that I was blinded until I took myself out of that environment. When we broke up, it was a physical altercation that his mom and step dad walked in on, we were both intoxicated as we were all hanging out and drinking. After this all went down he stormed out and told me to get lost and that he‚Äôll send me my ‚Äúshit.‚Äù And blocked me. Me and his mom talked for a bit after, and she told me some shocking things that made me feel insanely guilty and like the worst person ever. I am literally going insane in my own mind because I feel so terrible.\n\nSo the first time he hit me, and it was really hard, I said I was going to call the cops and he was going to go to jail if he continued to hurt me, after he heard this he literally held me down and punched me straight in the back of the head and proceeded to flip me over and look me straight in the eyes and strangle and slap me. His mom told me she used to call the police on him when he was 14 because he had a temper problem and almost hurt her. She also punched him in the nose because he was disrespecting her at one point. She also called the cops on him regularly to have him ‚Äútrained‚Ä¶‚Äù they would come to the house and push him around and force him to do things. I can see this trauma translated and I never knew this prior to talking to his mom, and I feel such a huge knot in my stomach. I definitely triggered him‚Ä¶ he has me blocked and I haven‚Äôt tried to reach out either.\n\nAlso to add more context, I am a huge empath so things like this haunt me for days. I will literally feel guilt for the smallest things for people I don‚Äôt even know. I don‚Äôt know how to get rid of this feeling like everything was my fault. I know this may sound annoying and silly, but I truly have no one to talk to, he was my person for everything and now I feel like I have so much inside so I guess this is my last resort. I will also be seeking therapy as soon as my semester ends. ",

        "text": "I‚Äôve been in a sort of depressive slump for a while now. It got really bad a few months ago and I ended up admitting myself to a psych facility for about a week. I think a lot of it can be attributed to my PTSD, autism, and probable chronic illness. I‚Äôm not diagnosed as chronically ill yet, but I‚Äôm in constant pain at 18 and I have a long family history of chronic illness. The ptsd is the reason for my major depressive episode a few months ago. I‚Äôm currently not suicidal and have never truly wanted to kill myself. I‚Äôve absolutely wanted to die, but in more of a ‚ÄúI wanna close my eyes and never wake up‚Äù kinda way. I‚Äôm excited for my future, but I often wonder if it‚Äôll be worth it. What kind of life can I live if I‚Äôm constantly sick and in pain. My ptsd is from childhood medical trauma, and I‚Äôm so scared that my chronic illness is going to make me relive it over and over forever until there‚Äôs nothing left of me. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never be able to hold a job or stable relationship if I can hardly hold a normal conversation or stay in public without being physically and emotionally exhausted after an hour. I can‚Äôt keep up a consistent schedule but I also need one to function. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly disappointing people and I‚Äôm hardly keeping up with my school. I love drawing and animation and storytelling, but I‚Äôve also been in a major creative slump, even since before the psych ward. The only thing that consistently brings me joy anymore is Minecraft. I play an unhealthy amount and I feel myself getting deeper into this cycle of depression and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I really don‚Äôt want to go back to the psych ward. It wasn‚Äôt an awful experience but it definitely wasn‚Äôt pleasant. The only thing it really did for me was watch me and make sure I didn‚Äôt hurt myself. I cut myself for the first and hopefully only time last week. I know I should tell someone, but it‚Äôs just gonna go back to my mom, and I really don‚Äôt want her to know. I‚Äôve really damaged my relationship with her recently. I‚Äôm constantly a frustration to her and we had a really bad fight during my last depressive episode. I lost a classmate to suicide quite recently and she‚Äôs been worried out of her mind since then. Confirming her fears is just going to be more stressful for everyone, especially since I‚Äôve told her repeatedly that I‚Äôm not depressed. She gets really moody and irritable when she‚Äôs stressed, and she‚Äôs already working full time as a 2nd grade teacher with a chronic illness and taking care of both me and a friend whose family moved away. Her being worried only makes my mental health worse. I‚Äôm just scared of what could happen if I tell someone. I need to get out of this but I just don‚Äôt know how.",

        "title": "The Dark Dragon that Gnaws on my heart",
        "text": "Ever since I was but a petit child, I found myself haunted by the horrible Black Hound that is Depression. It took 2 or 3 years before my mother took me to a mental hospital and get diagnosed. It took another year before she finally begin to truly understand this great pain that tears away at my mind, soul (if there is such a thing as a soul) and body. (But still, despite her various misunderstandings and her inability to understand certain parts of my suffering, I love her, and I know that she did her damnedst and best to care for ne, and genuinely loves me. And I thank her for it.)\n\nI tried everything I could, and within my ability. Video games? It only works as a painkiller, and I knew it since day one. Socializing? Nope, bullies circled above my head like a flock of vultures ever since kindergarten, and my friends have all been dispersed around my homeland, unwillingly, for better education. Plus, school rules forbid us from making friends ever since Middle School. Online socializing? Nope, didn't work out either. Got framed as a closeted pedophile by the very group of people I viewed as \"friends.\" Not to mention how murky and aggressive the Internet became, both in my homeland and outside of it. Suicide attempts? Only cultivated my fear for death. Taking breaks from school? Nope, doesn't work either. Since COVID-19 struck humanity, my family's barely keeping itself up, so I don't have the budget for a therapist, and when I do have it, school will occupy my time for them again.\n\nAnd that's when I saw within my fractured, broken heart and saw it. My Depression. It was left to its own devices for far too long. It was no longer a few grey splotches, or a Black Hound. It was a Dragon. A Dark Dragon that coils around my ailing heart. It drags me down into the darkest mires of despair, where both struggling and drifting along its flow brings great suffering. It brings me into the eye of a maelstrom, the maw of an all-devouring beast that eats away at the things I once loved, along with the love that I had for them. It taunts me with whispers only I can hear and it torments me with outlandish nightmares, in which I never stood, stand and possibly will not stand a chance. It forces my mind into a long, never-ending panic, a train of thoughts so derailed and nightmarish, that I have absolutely no control over. An abominable thing which I must get accustomed to. And in its eyes and it my own eyes, I see no hope. For me, and for humanity.\n\nWhen I was younger, I became depressed because I became jaded. Burdened with monotonous tasks everyday, constantly bullied and made fun of, jerkass teaches that scream and squeal at me, with some even beating me. I saw no future for myself. Correction, I saw nothing but darkness in my future. But now, I see that not only is my future shrouded, humanity's future too became uncertain to my eyes.\n\nHumanity chained itself with its own creations, languages, orders of symbols, religions, ideologies, and more, and became entwined in earthly warfares of mind and body, perpetuating its own loop of torment. Religions fight each other. People of different countries. Races. Different regions, different ideologies. They curse each other with the worst profanities they have, swear oaths to eradicate each other, wipe each other from the face of Earth, and sacrifice each other to the cruel deity that is humanity itself. And when I try to understand something, they only curse me, too. \"Petit-Bourgeois Parasite!\" \"Sinner!\" \"Heretic!\" \"Short-sighted Idiot!\" \"Weeb!\" And so I only become more pained in this world that never seemed to show any mercy to me and all humans. All humans but those who chose to relish in hurting others.\n\nIronically, I have chosen to chain myself to this world with my creation as well. A colorful cast of characters for a story of mine. In creating them, I have anchored my weathered spirit to them. They have offered me comfort and hope, where religions and propagandas failed, and both rationality and irrationality became more bearable with them. Because of them, I remain bound to this human experience. They are my children, and I love them. I want to bring them to the day of light, bring their stories to fruition. But despair soon struck again.\n\nNow, the world teeters on the brink of chaos and damnation, cast down by none other than humanity itself. Everything is falling apart, and I fear that the future might just destroy my children, and me. I fear that I have become the residue of an old world, which the new world shall forever be intolerant to. I fear that my children will be destroyed before I die, before my very eyes. I know that death will claim me, no matter how hard I cheat it, but it still terrifies me to think that my children, who I love and care, will be destroyed before I do.\n\nI have grown too old in mind. Fears have taken root in my heart. Despite barely reaching my 20s, I feel like a dying old man, wandering an endless desert, with every path leading to my grave, and the graves of my children. I fear that those who horde wealth with endless greed shall transform this world into one where only the elite are allowed to thrive whilst everyone else are forced to languish. I fear that those who view an ideal world will, out of perchance misguided faith, destroy my children, me, my mother, and others like me. I fear that humans may regress into an age comparable to the Middle Ages, where \"holy wars\" rage eternal and me, my family and my children forever rendered as \"heretical\" and \"demonic,\" or too, forced to languish while the \"chivalric\" and the elite thrives and feeds on such pain. I fear that even if none of that happens, my children will be viewed as lowly as dirt, me a worthless piece of waste and my mother, a mother of a monster, forever unloved and cursed to suffer this human society, this prison of various shapes, sizes and colors which we have built upon ourselves.\n\nI am so scared. I am so lost. Despair overwhelms me, and yet there is nothing I can do. Perhaps I am too showy, too exaggerated in your opinion, and perhaps I am. But I have been overburdened with the weight of my sorrows and fears, and there is nothing I can do, but to drag my husk along the march of time for another day, praying for a salvation that no deities ever offered, a salvation that may never come. To me, my children, or us.\n\nThere are so many other things I want to say, but I'd better stop here. My words fail me at my attempts to describe my despair, as I find no words in my vocabukary to truly, aptly describe this harrowing pain.\n\nI used to dream big. I once wanted to be a successful man, so that my mother may be happy. I once wanted to be a successful creator, who can bring happiness to others like me and achieve my dreams. Now? I just want to find a sliver of peace of mind and body for me, my mother and my children. Beyond that, nothing else is necessary, or even needed. Just this is enough. Just this is enough for me.\n\nIs even this too fucking much to ask for......?",

It seems it would be so tranquil there without any one to seek validation from or caring what they think. To give into the desire to become a recluse is a comforting yet painful idea. I hate my brain. I hate social media and the internet. I hate modern society. People are fine, but I don't understand why I seek validation from them so much. CBD oil helps somewhat but these thoughts still exist. I'm so lonely. It is absolutely agonizing to have no-one close enough and not have any motivation to change that. I'm in college and it feels like everyone has extremely active social lives and exist with ease, but everyone has their set of problems. My mind doesn't allow this thought process to exist emotionally. I go to parties then leave immediately due to my sheer awkwardness and anxiety.\n\nShit, my thoughts are so chaotic and harmful. Why can't my brain just shut the fuck up and leave my emotions stable? Why must I envy others when that just dampens my own motivation?\n\nI feel like the above stream-of-consciousness reflects my thought patterns. I constantly think about what others think of me and then question the social interactions I had with them as well as my own life choices. There is nothing like trying to relax and then that is undermined by things like \"I need to stop spending so much\" or some other anxiety.",

        "text": "So, to all my fellow unlucky war buddies who just can't seem to find anything that helps, how has your journey been? I'm just curious to hear other experiences.\n\nHere's mine. Diagnosed at 26(F) but I've felt like crap since I was at least 21. I'm 37 now. My main issues are extreme tiredness ALL the time (I can sleep for 16h straight, no problem) and lack of motivation, joy for life. Some bouts of sadness and anger but that has more to do with the terrible things that have happened to me, and trauma. Not necessarily suicidal but indifferent.\n\nMy first med was buproprione (wellbutrin). Psych made it out to be amazing. I would lose weight and stop smoking. Instead it made me irrationally angry and anxious. I gave it 6 weeks.\n\nAfter that I tried fluoxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, agomelatin, some others that I don't even remember, a multitude of combos with or without ritalin to give me energy or anxiety meds to counteract the anxiety. It's been a fun ride but most meds did nothing, fortunately I haven't had many side effects except for crazy weight gain from mirtazapine (15lbs in 5 weeks) and another one that gave me night sweats. There are at least 3 or 4 other drugs I'm not remembering right now.\n\n5 years ago, my doctor decided to try venlafaxine. Game changer! I felt normal for the first time in over 6 years. I could work, go to the gym, take care of my house. I was a functional adult again! Lost weight too and was in the best shape of my life. But then it pooped out after 9 months. Trying to get out of it was terrible, crying spells, a sense of desperation that I couldn't explain. Finally doc paired it with Prozac and that helped immensely.\n\nOver the last few years I've been on venlafaxine on and off. It doesn't really do much but since it's the only thing that ever did... I'm now weening off and starting vortioxetine. Never heard of it but I'm hopeful, I'm already feeling more energetic on day 2 which is probably Placebo (but I never got any Placebo effects with the others so who knows?).\n\nIt's wild to me how many drugs I've been on over the years, and how resistant my stupid depression is to seemingly all of them. What are your stories?",

        "text": "Hi I am male 32 year old. I had severe depression for last 6-7 years and anxiety since 2013. I have tried almost all meds used for anxiety and depression in past 5 years. You name it. Nothing worked. I was suicidal when I had to change my psych due to location move. New psych put me on 6 meds this September. Amisulpride 200 and fluoxetine 60 mg  during day and amisulpride 200 mg with quetipine 400mg and divalproex 750 mg and combo of clonazepam 0.5 and escitalopram oxalate 20 mg during night. It worked like a charm for me from first week only. Since then I have been out of depression and anxiety both. Feels awesome. A bit spontaneous though. Energetic too. It was a wish come true. Although I kept taking alcohol on regular basis with them too as I have been drinking for a long time. But this November I quit alcohol too as I have good mood usually and don't need it. \n\nBUT the problem is I have now no sexual drive. Zero, nada , zilch. Can't even masturbate. No erection, no intrest in porn. I am unmarried and 32 but soon I ll get married so this sexual disbalance can't go on. What should I do. I don't want depression back. But I also want to be able to enjoy sex.",

However, I've come to the conclusion that this is no reason to put off asking for advice.\n\nI'm 21M and since I broke up a 5yr relationship with my ex-gf about 1 year ago, I've had major self-image and insecurity issues. Although It's better now, I still regularly have these depressive episodes where I just feel like I can't take it any more. \n\n1. I look at every single imperfection in my appearance.\n2. I shut out my friends or act weirdly to them. I also don't want to burden them with my shit.\n3. I question everything I said or did to other people, and overthink a lot about my behaviour. \n4. I feel misunderstood regularly and like a misfit regularly. Probably because I have been diagnosed with a form of autism, and hence a lot of people misunderstand things that I say or do, and I notice when it happens, which makes it suck even more.\n5. I do sometimes have these passive suicidal thoughts. I would never act on them, but they are there, unfortunately.\n\nLuckily these are just episodes, and they usually only last a few hours, but they happen quite regularly. I've always had good and bad days, I mean doesn't everyone? But I feel like it has got worse. I have never been formally diagnosed with depression. I'm not sure what to do, and how to get rid of these episodes, or how to make them less frequent, so I'm really looking for some advice.",

        "text": "Like all throughout middle school I had a little group of close friends in an otherwise hostile school environment and now (I‚Äôm 21M as of writing) all those friends either abandoned me or ghosted me, including my best friend who was gay and I didn‚Äôt see that he liked me at the time. Got back into contact with him again some while ago in a pivotal point where I was confused about what I am (sexuality wise) just to be told ‚Äúyeah man. Good hearing from you.‚Äù And then was blocked. Then not even a couple weeks later I find that my childhood best friend I lost contact with after moving (I was like 9) ended up OD‚Äôing behind a dumpster after suffering from homelessness. \n\nI just keep praying and praying that I find that special someone to fill the hole but dating is an even worse nightmare. All my coworkers either hooked up with each other or met by other means while most of my remaining online friend group is happily married. I wanna meet someone but I‚Äôm always told to go to clubs or bars or something, like no I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or do drugs of any kind so I‚Äôm not gonna go blind dating. \n\nAfter all this, I found myself trying to make myself happy with drawing online, constantly uploading and interacting with other artists posts but I feel even further from people then I did before, seeing them all say ‚Äúall my mutuals DM me so we can all play Atlyss together!‚Äù Or something along those lines. \nMy only remaining friend who seems to care for me is Christian and turned me onto forming a relationship with God but I‚Äôm so hellbent on science and reason that I feel like no matter how much ‚Äúfaith‚Äù I have that there‚Äôs a divine being outside mortality I‚Äôll never be able to hear anything from them. I feel alone all across the spectrum. \n\nI just‚Ä¶ wish I could tell people my story. It feels unfair, and maybe I‚Äôm not that trustworthy of a friend despite that, even hypocritical, the fact that I‚Äôm willing to accept any and all knowledge of a persons being and accepting them regardless, but that I don‚Äôt trust anyone enough, even those same people, with my own knowledge and history. I‚Äôve been hurt too many times to trust anyone with it. Even my most trivial little secrets are my most precious and the ones I feel would ruin a relationship between me and someone else, or my image of me to them. Yet I close myself off. \n\nThey say when you invite someone into your little sanctuary, you offer them your very being, laid out on a table. That moment is the maker or breaker. \nI‚Äôve just been broken too many times. Maybe I‚Äôve invited the wrong people, or maybe my secrets are just too heinous for anyone to hold without being revolted. Who knows. \n\nI just know that it‚Äôs almost not worth telling your whole story to even your closest friends. It‚Äôs like the childish tendency to get bored and repelled by reading a book takes over when you try to speak your tale.\n\nJuan is dead. \nJacob ghosted me.\nJosh stopped caring, but still keeps contact. \nEmerald took advantage of me, brushing me off.\nDaniel Hing sits too high on a throne to care.\nZach brushes it off as a daily tale with no moral. \nAiden pretty much solidified it when I told him a sensitive part of me, my tendency to cross-dress (that we‚Äôve talked about many times before as he‚Äôs done it a time or two), and ghosted me for a week; following up with ‚Äúsome things are just better left to yourself‚Äù. \n\nEven my own siblings don‚Äôt reach out to me and my close family I live with ridicules me for any outlandish hobbies and only finds respect in me as a Blue collar ‚Äúworking man‚Äù. I‚Äôm just so tired of it all. I fear the unknown and death, so I‚Äôm far from taking my own life, but the fact is I know people would cry at my demise should it ever happen yet it doesn‚Äôt make it any better. But that‚Äôs how it goes, right? You live your whole life being alone, everyone keeping themselves at fingertips reach from you, only for them bring flowers to your funeral and say ‚Äúhe was a good friend‚Äù as if they tried to reach out even once. \n\nI try and try to find sociability in places I shouldn‚Äôt, like the cruel world of twitter (hence the whole art and mutuals thing) and I always find myself back here; in another place online asking strangers for help knowing I‚Äôll probably just get the ever looping answer of ‚Äúit gets better. Just put yourself out there. Friends are waiting, the girl of your dreams is waiting.‚Äù Like I haven‚Äôt been trying since I finished middle school. \n\nI don‚Äôt think it does get better. I try to convince myself I‚Äôm still young and that I‚Äôve got a whole journey ahead of me but I‚Äôve only just started my flight training with a hopeful dream of flying for the airlines. But it always reminds me of my own mortality when I see the only pilots that are flourishing and happy (friends, money, wife/kids) are the ones with gray hair and nearing retirement, or the ones who were born into a wealthy family who inherited a business and use flying as Plan B. \n\nIt just feels so unfair, yet I feel ashamed of thinking that because there‚Äôs people in way worse situations than me. I mean, I live in a first world country after all, right? That makes it all better right? Nah. Same problems, different clothes. I could have been born a fox eating berries from a bush without a worry to mind, but instead I‚Äôve been burdened with the curse of intelligence and awareness of one‚Äôs own existence that leads to inevitable self destruction. \n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs my story. Thanks for listening I guess, assuming you‚Äôve read this far. Sometimes it just feels good to write words even though you know they won‚Äôt be seen. ",

It doesn't even feel good but I still can't stop. I also have PMO addiction, it doesn't even feel good but I still do it anyway. Recently I also discovered gambling and then I lost all my money and now I am absolutely broke and have no money to even buy lunch at school. I literally wake up, scroll on my phone, jerk off and feel bad about it before going to bed but still repeat the same cycle tomorrow. I also regret losing all the money I had saved due to gambling. It's not a lot but it was a significant amount to me.\n\n\nI also feel very insecure about myself because I am literally good at nothing. I see many of my friends and they are good at something like a particular sport or studies etc. Meanwhile I am literally good at nothing and I don't think I have any useful skills or hobbies. I really wanna get things done but I end up procrastinating and never do them. Honestly I kinda feel insecure and jealous seeing other people's success.\n\nI also recently got rejected by a girl I liked and honestly I can't blame her. Because I'm literally worthless so I don't see why she would choose a guy like me. She clearly deserves better.\n\nAnd it's not just that... I feel like I am constantly failing my parents and letting them down. They have high expectations from me but I keep letting them down. I was not like this when I was younger. I used to be a good kid. But now I am literally not studying at all and failing in my exams. Also I have the most important exam of my life next year. Still I am not studying and if I don't my life is probably gonna be ruined. And honestly it hurts because my dad is spending a lot of money on my education. My parents are providing me with everything I need and I am very grateful to them but still I can't get the only thing done which they expect from me. They just want me to do good in school. Yet I don't even study for a minute. I can't even concentrate and I think I might have ADHD.\n\nI'm sorry if all of this was too long. I just needed to get this off my chest. Honestly these days I don't even have the will to live. I feel so depressed for no reason all day. The only time I feel happy is ig when I am with my friends. But still I can't share everything with them. I just feel ashamed and I don't wanna burden them with all my problems. So I thought I would just let it all out here.",

I started lexapro in 2020 and it was a life saver honestly. I came off a few months ago due to weight gain and now I‚Äôm regretting it because my depression has came back and it‚Äôs been really dark for me the past few weeks. My current bf is one of those people that says ‚Äúeveryone has depression, just think positive‚Äù and it‚Äôs so hard being with someone like him. I tried to explain how depression is completely different from just having normal stress or having a bad day/week, and that it consumes me and makes me unable to feel any joy or happiness no matter how hard I try. He says things like ‚Äúcan you stop talking about how much you hate your life before you make me start hating mine‚Äù or ‚Äúok stop complaining and just get back on your medication‚Äù I tried to have a conversation about it telling him my whole life I‚Äôve been trying so hard to just survive, and how I hate that I haven‚Äôt been the best mom lately to my kids because I‚Äôve been lacking patience, motivation, literally even the will to get up out of bed. He then compares me to my addict sister that abandoned her kids and says maybe you feel like your sister did and just want to escape your kids. Like what?! I‚Äôm literally telling you how I want to be the best mom for them and I‚Äôm just ready to be out of this dark place. I‚Äôm starting to think that people with depression need to only be with people who also deal with some sort of mental illness, so they understand what you go through.",

Then I was 19 and I had cried, like really cried, for the first time since I couldn't remember when. I broke down about my dad and the fractured picture that was my family. Then for the next ten years my episodes were still filled with anger, but now I was embarrassed by my rage, that embarrassment would then be replaced by sadness. For the past year my episodes haven't been episodes, they have been calm serene moments of clarity, where I come to reasonable conclusions about committing suicide. Does this mean I'm losing and becoming more comfortable with the idea of just letting go and saying goodnight? Or am I becoming disassociated with my depression? I don't know.\n\nWhat I do know is that, during my episodes, the idea of never existing or never having existed and just being in total nothing, pure silence, sounds like a Calm Serenity. ",

I have been suffering from depression since I was 13, now I am 20, and nothing has improved, it has even become harder to bear. Three months ago, I had a period where I thought I was going to die because I had a lot of panic attacks. These have subsided since I started taking Buspirone and Zoloft, but the feeling of sadness won‚Äôt go away. Plus, two days ago, I gathered the courage to tell the person I love how I feel about her. We have known each other since we were 7 years old, we went to middle school together, and now we are at the same university, but in different specializations. She is at the Faculty of Mechanics, and I am at the Faculty of Construction. To cut a long story short, she told me that we are just good friends and nothing more. I feel sad, I thought maybe I would find someone who understands me and, besides that, could also love me. Anyway, I feel sadder than usual. But the medication is working because if this had happened before I started taking it, maybe I would have taken my own life. The thing is, I don‚Äôt see any sense in all this nonsense. We come into this world without being asked. We have to endure the ugly and the beautiful of life without wanting it. Yes, it‚Äôs hard to exist. So many years I thought I could be loved, I was terribly wrong, and I lived a lie. I hate that I am the way I am because I know no one seeks sadness in life, and I, with my pessimistic ideas about existence, do nothing good about it. I won‚Äôt drag it out any longer, if you got this far. Thank you for listening.",

I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder 6 years ago, been in therapy for those 6 years. \n\nIn my life I've been scammed, lost friends and family by way of them just disappearing out of my life.  Pretty common things surely, and I've made it through all of that.  Spent too much time in a job I hated.  Finally got a job (for three years now) that i like and started to feel confident for the first time.  Finally felt comfortable enough with myself to go on dates. \n\nThen my living situation changed, i started paying more money towards just living in general, for the first time in my life my bank account is (currently) in the negative and i feel more helpless then ive ever felt in my entire life.\n\nThis is my all time low and i hate it a lot.  Of course my family doesn't understand at all and give me the \"just try to focus on your goals\", or \"just stay positive\", which they think is helpful because of course they do right?\n\nAt the same time a lot of people i know are flourishing and i hate myself even more for feeling jealous sometimes of those people and thinking that I deserve those things, and can't even fathom how to get to them right now.\n\nJust to clarify sorry if this is over sharing or rambling at this point, never in my life have I ever or will I ever think about or consider hurting myself, I just needed a new way to express that I'm just hating life right now, and need to bounce back in the worst way.  Okay I'm done now, thats my story in a very very condensed version.  Thanks.",

I haven‚Äôt had a real conversation with them in weeks, and I haven‚Äôt even gone to class for the last three months. I‚Äôm living in a university dorm where everyone is just as lost as I am.

        "text": "I've been in the same depressed rut since I guess 2018. There have been up and down moments, Uni was alright and I was climbing back on the horse, until hair loss destroyed my confidence in 2019 and lockdown almost cost me my degree in 2021.\n\nSince finishing uni in 2021 though, I've been stuck desperately searching for a full time job I can actually handle.\n\nUnfortunately, that's very specific. I cannot bring myself to care about stuff I have no interest in and since there's not a paying job on the planet that fits that does interest me, at least none that aren't super hard to get into, my job choices are limited to mindless low pressure environments where it doesn't matter if I want to slit my wrists.\n\nSociable jobs are definitely a no go, I was a social disaster when I still had my hair, now I have literally no confidence, I can't do that every day, and my cofidence is already getting lower with how many lines I'm starting to notice on my face at only 25. \n\nI thought you weren't supposed to start seeing signs of aging until your 30s? Why do I have the hairline of a 45 year old and the wrinkles of a 35 year old? I know I eat like shit, but I exercise, I don't smoke and rarely drink, there are people who take much worse care of their body than me that still look like a bloody teenager.\n\nI also need sociable hours. Literally need them. I can't work nights or early, believe me I've tried it, I feel tired every waking moment.\n\nI can't work evenings because that's when the only good things in my life happen with an amateur drama group I used to enjoy.\n\nUnfortunately, my current job is a part time Domino's delivery cyclist. I fucking hate it.\n\nFirst off it only works evenings. For over a year I've had to put my only form of fun social activity on hold, and missed dozens of family get togethers, as well as missing the Euros because every England football game is when everyone wants Pizza. \n\nI hate cycling in general and I have to spend time on bike maintenance and other tedious shit I don't care about. Got my bike stolen one time as well.\n\nBut its just bearable. I can look super miserable as long as I want so long as I look somewhat presentable for ten seconds every twenty minutes when I hand the customer a pizza. And they're relaxed enough on the rules that I can stick one headphone in and listen to music all night.\n\nBut I'm 25, and I want to move out. I'm trying to claw my way out of this rut and its fucking impossible.\n\nI want my evenings back so I can actually do the one part of my week I actually enjoy, but an entry level 9 to 5 job that doesn't require lots of social interaction and is entry level doesn't exist.\n\nI've even got chewed up posting on recruiting hell with everyone telling me they wouldn't employ me. Real fucking helpful, I know I'm a shit worker that doesn't change the fact that I need work.\n\nRight now my only hope is in learning to drive, but even that isn't going to help me that much, because I can't drive a manual which is what every employer in the UK seems to be asking for.\n",

I didn't attend any of the classes properly because my mother forcibly sent me to a vocational high school. I also didn't see the quantitative classes. So this year, i started to go to prep school so i can pass the university exam and go to a good university. At first, my mother was very supportive but then she changed again. She didn't give a f- when i couldn't understand the classes. She just played with her damn phone. She always tells that the education was better in her times. It's true but i'm not bad about that. I'm mad because she knew that I wouldn't be happy and difficult in vocational high school, and that I wouldn't take most classes. Now i'm strugling between my school, internship, prep school and my fucking mental health.\n\nI don't think she ever loved me yk. She always looked at me like i'm some work to she needs to take care of. She gave me a life just to control everything. I don't think i wanna be an astronomer anymore. I just hate everything. I'm always unhappy and suicidal. It's impossible to love someone like me. I'm always sad, quiet, mad, negative about everything, boring, suicidal and etc. Like i get it i'm a shitty daughter. I get it father left you before i born and you're sad. I get it your family never loved me. I get it you're learning with me. \n\nI know it's her first time in this life but it's also my first time in this life. She shoul've here for me when i got bullied, raped, hospitalized or etc. I stopped wanting help from her. I stopped going to prep school. I stopped to study. Actually i can kill myself easily yk. But i can't because my gf would be so sad. I promised her to not try to attempt again. She's so caring and sweet towards me. We couldn't meet irl. I don't wanna meet irl because i'm scared. She will realise how ugly and useless i am. \n\nShe will! I know that. Even father and mother doesn't want me. I feel like i'm a piece of trash. I never get excited or happy. I'm just so exprionless. Yk the son Poker face? I literally have a poker face. I can't show any emotion and i'm not saying that just because i wanna be cool. I just can't. I'm 17 now and i don't have any plan for the future. I know i'm a big girl now and i know i need to grow up but i can't. I wanna cry in my mother's arms, play with her. I want her to read me books. I wanna be a little girl who has a family.\n\nI tried to be positive but no. I really hate everything. I'm like a walking corpse. So empty and stupid. I wish i had a talent but i'm not good at anything. I'm just waiting for my death. I hope i die soon. Sorry for being annoying. Sorry for being a cold hearted bitch. \n\nI never had a life. No one teached me how to love myself. Maybe i'll leave soon.\n\n(No, i can't go to a therapist cuz mother doesn't give a f about me and we don't have money. No i can't talk with school guidence service cuz they're shitty. No, i don't have any trusted adults and no i can't talk with my friends.)",

I've talked about it, and what has been painful, and worse, what serves to affirm my feelings of being stupid, inept, unable to function well, a loser, is that I was kicked of a Reddit site devoted to legal matters when I repeatedly tried to talk about it to get advice. I am 55, on disability for my depression and anxiety. I am in recovery from an eating disorder. I did not seek getting designated disabled, but my nephew used it against me in court, shamed me for it, also lying about some matters pertinent to my case.  His parents were my landlord for a decade, were selling the bldg, and under the false guise of saying I was messy and a 'hoarder', they evicted me saying I was not cleaning fast enough. I had a Dept of Health Disability & Senior Specialist come and check it out, said their eviction was nonsense, then they became hostile, banged & kicked on my door, threatened me, saying'If you think your brother is bad (he's a sometimes-violent drug addict they evicted for stealing) you haven't fu\\^ked with me yet!\" They did not go thru the legal process of eviction either. I got a new apt, my nephew helping me find it. I went to meet the landlord to sign the lease, get the keys, & to stay the night, and my nephew came by and asked for my keys to start packing for the move he was to help me do the next day with his truck and flatbed trailer. I cannot drive. He cancelled, then did for 30 days, then falsely claimed that bc my things were there that time period, it all became his & his parents. He then started threatening me with a 'harassment charge' if I contacted them again. The police would not help, I could not get an attorney, and then basically lost the civil court case I brought. I lost meaningful things, meds, glasses, inhalers, family photos, documents, etc, not just most all things I owned. I don't know why it happened. I showed 20+ emails proving my nephew made and cancelled moving efforts. I thnk i'm a nice person, but I lost faith in my family, the police, law, justice system, and I can't even go to Church or pray anymore.  I'm very poor, on SS & disability, food stamps, in a bad neighborhood of St. Louis, and have no friends or doctor. Please pray for me or send postive energy to me. Thank you. ",

        "text": "We‚Äôre both 23, we‚Äôve been married for five years. I‚Äôve dealt with depression pretty frequently, but in the household I was raised in, it was better to hide problems than to ask for help. \n\nAny illness, symptom, or anything like that, that would require professional help, was an incredibly huge inconvenience for my dad. Or even just staying home from school, there was no ‚Äúresting‚Äù to get better. You had to do something while you were home. You were never really sick. *So,* I‚Äôve grown into an adult that is petrified of being sick. Taking time to rest. Calling out of work. \n\nI don‚Äôt even currently work, I quit my job when we moved and decided to stay that way until after the holidays. I do everything around the house, and if I need a day to rest and get better from anything, I am riddled with guilt. \n\nLast year, I ended up in a situation where I had to see a psychiatrist in a hospital. Scared the daylights out of my husband. I continued to see her, but she wasn‚Äôt a great fit. I ended up quitting after so many rescheduled appointments on her end. \n\nI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just something to do with the time change or something like that. I deal with depression outside of the time change, but it does tend to get worse this time of the year. Normally, I‚Äôm able to hide it. As much as I want to rot in bed and just stare at the wall. Or cry. I know it‚Äôs a common thing for people with depression to say it isn‚Äôt just being sad. And it isn‚Äôt, but god, I am so fucking sad. I‚Äôm riddled with guilt over nothing. I feel like a dead weight. A burden. I‚Äôm tired of crying and hiding it. I still end up getting up in the morning, doing all my normal tasks throughout the day. I clean, I cook, I even take care of myself. \n\nBut the gnawing feeling I have in my chest is so unbearable. \n\nI feel so guilty for feeling like I need to tell my husband this. My life is *so* easy, I‚Äôm incredibly lucky to be able to stay home like I do. We can afford it. He works long hours and when he gets home, I‚Äôm very sure the last thing he wants to talk about is his wife and her feelings and how awful she feels when he would probably kill to be in my position. Even though I know for a fact, he‚Äôd want me to tell him how I feel. He said those exact words to me when he picked me up from the hospital. \n\nI feel so‚Ä¶ ungrateful? I‚Äôm in a position that many people in my life are jealous of, and I can‚Äôt even be happy about it? I can‚Äôt even enjoy it? I know I need to talk to him. No matter how closely he pays attention to me when we‚Äôre together, he‚Äôd never pick up on it. I‚Äôve made sure of it, I‚Äôve perfected my method in hiding it, so I have no choice but to communicate this problem to him and it terrifies me. I‚Äôm terrified of the questions he‚Äôll ask about how I feel. I‚Äôm terrified of what answers I‚Äôll give. Or how he‚Äôll react. \n\nI spent my entire life having my father get angry with me for not being fine, I always expect the same from him, even though it‚Äôs never happened. He‚Äôs never once gotten upset over anything being wrong with me. He wasn‚Äôt even necessarily upset when he picked me up from the hospital and didn‚Äôt know anything that had happened, he was worried. He was scared. He just wanted to know I was okay. No arguments, no lectures, no fighting. I just don‚Äôt know how to even start the conversation. ",

My dream in life was to become a successful singer-songwriter releasing and performing my own original music but after trying countless different paths towards this dream since I was 19, I've never even been within a million miles of even just having a shot at it. I truly do not see this dream happening anymore at this point no matter what I do or try or how hard I work towards it. I know that this dream is a one in a hundred million chance even if you're super talented but it was what I wanted out of my life but I just don't see any possibility for it anymore. \n\nI am completely alone in regards to romantic relationships. I can't even count the number of times I've had my heart broken over crushes or potential relationships that didn't end up panning out. I've only had 1 long-term relationship that lasted about 9 months but other than that I've never been able to be with anyone I wanted to be with. It's at a point now where I completely see that I will never be able to be with someone I'm attracted to and want to be with and that I will be alone forever. I don't have any friends because anytime I did, they always ended up hurting me and/or their morals and ways of going about life were incompatible with minebso I didn't want to keep the friendship going. \n\nI have a job working remotely as a pricing administrator for a manufacturing company and I absolutely hate it. The work involves extreme scrutiny and attention-to-detail towards data and prices all day and extensive use of Excel and it's in complete opposition to my personality. The only thing good about this job is I can work from home as if I had to work in the office I couldn't handle it because I feel everything so deeply and being in a noisy office surrounded by people all day completely exhausts me as I feel everything (emotions) from everyone all the time so it's beyond draining and stressful. \n\nI am extremely highly sensitive and feel emotions unbelievably deeply, not only my own but others' as well. I have always been this way and just going about in life day to day is beyond exhausting. Because of my nature like this, I found at 16 that writing songs allowed me a catharsis of releasing my extreme feelings that nothing else ever allowed me or ever has since then. This is why I wanted to become a singer-songwriter so badly as it allowed me a path through life that let me make sense of life and myself unlike anything else ever had. But that dream is truly dead and buried now. \n\nSo what reason is there to keep living when I don't have anything left to live for and truly don't see anything worth going on for in life? I have come to see life as absolutely pointless now as we all will die one day anyhow so what point is there to life if you know in your heart you'll never have any of the things you truly wanted? Why go on when you know there's nothing left but suffering for you? I believe that God or whatever higher power is out there truly has something against me as nothing I do or try to improve my life ever comes to be. I haven't done anything horrible enough to justify this type of constant suffering and emotional turmoil in life and I just dont understand it.  ",

For a long time, it felt like there was no way out, like the weight would never lift. I tried different medications, but nothing seemed to work long-term. I was stuck, and at times, I felt like I was just existing rather than living.\n\nThis year, I started Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and regular psychotherapy after leaving an abusive relationship, and it‚Äôs honestly changed my life. It wasn‚Äôt an overnight fix, but slowly, I began to understand my thoughts and behaviors better. CBT helped me reframe negative patterns, and therapy provided a safe space to explore deeper issues and trauma. Over time, I felt a shift. I haven‚Äôt just found peace, I‚Äôve found happiness again.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling, please know that recovery is possible. You can move beyond survival mode and find joy again. It may take time, and may require patience, but it‚Äôs possible. Recovery is hard, but it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nAnother thing that helped me immensely was evaluating the people in my life. Sometimes, we don‚Äôt realize how toxic or draining certain relationships can be. It wasn‚Äôt until I made the difficult decision to distance myself from some people that I noticed a significant improvement in my mental health. Getting rid of toxic or abusive people is critical, if you have that option.\n\nTake care of yourself. You deserve peace, you deserve happiness, you deserve freedom from panic attacks‚Äîand I promise you can get there. Keep going.",

My career was choppy and inconsistent. I barely ever knew myself or what I wanted or what I even felt. I was always numb and tried to escape into romantic relationships hoping at least someone would accept me for who I am someday. \n\nBy this point, I had friends, but none i could really open up to or who would understand me, and obviously I chose the wrong men to date given my mental health. \n\nThe turning point was 3 years ago when I met a man who seemed to accept me and love me for who I was. But he turned out to be the worst yet. He was a typical narcissist and emotionally abused me after love bombing me. \n\n3 years later I still cry everyday and curse him for what he did to me. It feels like everything is over. I can never trust anyone again. There's not a single person who will ever understand me. I feel like I failed in this life and i just want to throw everything away and start over. \n\nI still don't have the vocabulary or the comprehension to describe the full depth of my despair, but every single day is torture and i no longer know what to do.

Yong pointless ang buhay sa pananaw ko, sa daming bagay na pwedeng maging reason to just give up nalang.. first reason is we can't choose the environment we grow up in.. lalo na kung unstable and toxic environment yong kinalakihan natin. Tapos we have our failures pa while growing up and in choices sa maraming bagay..but I want you to choose to be strong para sa sarili mo. Lahat, dadaan lang.. at marami ka pang dadaanan. I'm hoping that you're open for a good start whenever you fall or fail, Kasi laging ganoon ang buhay. The only way you get to fail really and be defeated is when you fully give up on yourself. It's up to you to choose now, Kasi palaging Nagyon lang Ang Oras na Meron Tayo sa buhay. Tomorrow is not a promise and past is gone. We can't change the past.. I hope you can find healing and acceptance sa mga bagay na nangyari na at tapos na. You have to acknowledge what happened, your feelings for it.. at e let go Ang mga bagay na tapos na. Don't dwell. Tuloy lang Ang buhay.. habang andito pa Tayo, we still have a chance to choose to better ourselves and better our lives. In times na masyadong magulo Ang Mundo, we feel that maybe God is not real.. but in times like this, we need God. Iba Kasi yong kapag naniniwala ka, may source of belief ka na you are loved Kasi He let you see this world for a purpose of knowing Him. You'll have someone you can talk to and knows that He knows what's in your heart and in your mind. The world is broken.. Kaya madaming taong makaka experience ng brokenness dito. But we're all passing by.. bigyan mo ng halaga Ang sarili mo..wag mong hanapin yon sa iba.. dahil Hindi kayang punan ng iBang tao Ang expectations natin.. were all imperfect.. walang perfect life but we can choose the people we let into our lives now at sa napagdaanan mo, you'll know better this time Kasi based on experience Ang pag survive mo sa buhay. I hope you'll keep surviving. Kaya mo Yan..laban lang."

Ever since I read that it really got me thinking. I have about 55k in available credit, it would be one hell of a trip before I‚Äôm home bound. Maybe I‚Äôm just crazy.

I‚Äôm an engineering student and I‚Äôve gotten good grades in the past but I just can‚Äôt. My depression has me convinced that I have no curiosity and no desire to challenge myself. I come from a comfortable upbringing (just turned 20) and am suicidal because I feel like I‚Äôm literally too lazy to handle the adult world and will end up unaccomplished. I feel disconnected from my friends and family and  like I have nothing to say/contribute to conversations. I want to work harder but don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm terrified of the consequences of my own lack of logic and ability to make good decisions. I feel like a shell of a human being, I‚Äôm at the point where I just eat, use the bathroom, sleep, and sit around biting my nails.\n\nDoes anyone relate to this? Right now it feels like there‚Äôs no way out\n\nRight now I‚Äôm home for the holidays and finishing my school at home and I‚Äôm just disgusted by myself and I can‚Äôt stop. So much mental energy goes there instead of towards improving myself or even just living life.",

        "text": "It‚Äôs been over a year since I went through a rough and abusive relationship. I was the babysitter in the relationship (sounds bad to use that word but it‚Äôs the truth) but I still loved this person because they were my highschool sweetheart and crush and my bestfriend for over 3 years before we dated. To make it short, she was a sociopath with BPD and she physically and mentally abused me and I was doing bad, but I put up with it because I convinced myself that if I left her, I failed her as her partner, the person who should‚Äôve been protecting her and helping her. She ended up breaking up with me in the end which I think saved me from further abuse. \n\nI‚Äôm doing somewhat better now, I got myself a motorcycle, my M1 license, met new people who ride, got tattoos, changed a lot about my life style, and it felt great for awhile, but i‚Äôm slowly starting to lose interest in everything. I try and go out and do new things but, it‚Äôs so depressing and the experience sometimes isn‚Äôt worth doing it alone. I think I long for someone but I feel broken and would never want to burden someone with my problems. I hate feeling either somewhat or perfectly ok one day and completely out of it and no longer wanting to live the next day. I refuse to go to therapy or take medication because i‚Äôve only had bad experiences, been misdiagnosed numerous times, and given incredibly high dosages of medication that just turn me into a zombie. \n\nI have been depressed since the beginning of HS (MDD diagnosis at 12 and PTSD after relationship) it has only gotten worse in certain aspects. Back then, I only struggled to get up and do every day tasks, but I didn‚Äôt long for anyone nor feel lonely. Now I somewhat struggle to do every day tasks but feel incredibly alone and feel like no one understands me despite being surrounded by friends now. I wish I could go to my friends and explain to them how I FEEL but I know I would be ostracized because of it and lose my friends that way, so I just suck it up and let it boil inside of me. I just want people‚Äôs help to see what they do when they feel like this, where they go, who they talk to. I have my momentary escapes like my motorcycle and spending an arbitrary amount of money (bad habit) but in the end, it makes me feel good in the moment but never fulfills me.  If this all sounds monotone, I apologize, I don‚Äôt even have the energy to type any of this out but I‚Äôve exhausted all my options and I feel lost and out of time. ",

We started dating when I was 17, and she‚Äôs the sweetest girl I‚Äôve ever met to this day. To clarify we lived together but we broke when I turned 19, so it‚Äôs been 3 years no contact. But we had the most loving relationship, we went through struggle together. So much of it, it always felt like we were in a hole but I had her by my side so I felt invincible. We were just so young, and didn‚Äôt have the means to do a lot of things financially. Got evicted two times, and she was still there with me trying to find solutions all while loving me and I her. Until I succumb to alcohol because I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress, I would drink so much to the point where I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her and would be gone. I was a shitty person and I understand that, so for obvious reasons she left me. Over these past 3 years I‚Äôve grown so much, I stopped drinking like I did and actually learned to cope in other ways like going to the gym or just by going on walks when I‚Äôm stressed out I even lost 30lbs. After some time I found myself thinking of her more and more, so I tried even harder to become a better person. Not just for me but for her if the day were to ever come yk. And well that day came about a month ago, and she was just as sweet as the day we met. I was honestly surprised because yk I used to be an alcoholic. So we caught up, and we talked about everything. She made it known to me that she wanted to start from a new, and ofc I was ecstatic about it. We even met up a little over two weeks into it and we just held on to each other like there was no tomorrow. And so she was telling me all of these sweet things, I did the same. I love her with every fiber of my being, and today she tells me otherwise. She said she‚Äôs in love with me still but it wasn‚Äôt the right time. Which id understand, so I‚Äôm a mess right now. I wanted to have a drink, honestly. But that‚Äôd do more bad than good. And I don‚Äôt want to fall into old habits again, especially after working on myself so much. But I guess this begs the question am I unloveable? Do I not deserve it? at least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm feeling right now. ",

Then the pandemic started, and I fell into drugs‚Äîmostly because my parents had no idea how I felt, and they didn‚Äôt even want to know. For another year, I lived in one huge lie. When everything came out, my mom finally realized what was happening and started trying to help me.\n\nIt led to a stay in a mental ward. I was hospitalized at a children‚Äôs ward since I was two months shy of turning 18. That‚Äôs enough about me for now, but here‚Äôs what I want to tell you: I hated every fucking one, and most hated fucker was myself, back then. And most of all, I hated the doctor who sent me there.\n\nWhen I got back home, I was still the same angry idiot. It took me another year to quit drugs, but I managed it because of one thing. When I returned home, my parents were totally different. Sure, they kept an eye on me, but they stopped treating me like I was 12 years old.\n\nEverything changed‚Äînot just them, but everyone around me. They finally understood how close I was to taking my own life, and they realized I wasn‚Äôt the person they thought I was, or maybe the person they wanted me to be.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm trying to say is this: I know you‚Äôre going through hell, and you probably don‚Äôt want to open up to anyone. But until you tell your therapist and psychiatrist the full truth, they won‚Äôt be able to help you.\n\nMaybe you don‚Äôt really want to help yourself right now, but I believe there‚Äôs something deep inside you that still wants to live. Life isn‚Äôt a nice place to be, but there‚Äôs no better option.\n\nI don‚Äôt know you, and if you died tomorrow, I probably wouldn‚Äôt feel much. But you remind me of my own past. I still deal with a lot of shit in my head, and this past year has been extremely stressful and hard. I‚Äôve thought about using drugs again or ending it all almost every day.\n\nBut even though winter is here, I feel like I‚Äôm entering a better phase of my life.Hold on, stay stromg. Don‚Äôt let any motherfucker take your live, you can not give up to them. Ily, and I hope you‚Äôll find same long and fucking road to feel lucky, like I did."

My dad emotionally abused me you could say from a young age till I stop seeing him with the stereotypical men can‚Äôt cry men can‚Äôt sleep with a teddy (mate I‚Äôm like 10 ofc I‚Äôm gonna have teddy) he would withhold it from me and shout constantly at me for crying even tho it was valid and I slept in loft/atttic. I‚Äôve never been popular and had decently low confidence as I slowly got older and used to get upset a lot in school from bullying etc but that stopped a long time ago I‚Äôve been the typical last pick for sports but that don‚Äôt bother me, when I was about 11 or something I witnessed a close person to me self harm who was older than me by like 2 years and it shocked me seeing all the blood and scars but I think I‚Äôve blocked it out kind of. Then 3 years later my mum died who was my right hand person for a life since my dad had a poor relationship with me. Me and my dad are fine now but he acts like he doesn‚Äôt even remember what he‚Äôs did. My stepdad struggled I think with me and my sibling but found new love 3 years after my mum which is really horrible for me, not because I think he shouldn‚Äôt be with anyone else I used to think that but it‚Äôs completely illogical but it‚Äôs the person he chose who‚Äôs much below him I think, I heard them have sex in my mums bedroom which put me in a panic attack I had to kinda get myself through this was all at like 4am. Ever since then I‚Äôve not really trusted him.\n\nI have an addiction to master baiting  which I think will counter argue my thoughts about having depression. I‚Äôve never had a relationship with a girl but I feel very different weird when I was practically in one I‚Äôve had my struggles with anxiety and when I was in school I saw a councillor for 2 years mostly speaking about my anxiety and mum.\n\nCurrent day: I‚Äôm 18 and work full time my life feels boring and numb all the time and I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt happy I do things because I have to or bc I should? But I‚Äôve not been properly happy or laughed in a while. My life feels like a chore sometimes and it‚Äôs just annoying as it just seems to get shitter when there‚Äôs an opportunity most times. I think my lack of happiness comes from my addiction to master baiting which has fucked my dopamine and this is why I feel more sad than I feel happy most times i don‚Äôt have feelings of self harm but I have cravings and cravings for attention which have resulted in fucked in thoughts I‚Äôve had which would get me attention like killing myself so I could have a funeral and everyone would speak about me. I wouldn‚Äôt act of these things but it‚Äôs gives me some sort of buzz thinking about them. I‚Äôm not a bad person at heart I promise. I do believe I am a kind person but I can‚Äôt remember the last time I got enjoyment from something like games or sports etc. I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôvegot depression and I‚Äôm not here to beg for your attention or to inflict harm on yhe people of the subreddit as you are all incredibly strong I believe for being here. My life is just boring, numb and existing because I can. I have no discipline in my life and it‚Äôs shit but it‚Äôs my own fault.\n\nI used to smoke weed basically everyday when I was in school and when I left I‚Äôve stopped now but I did enjoy it a bit but always made me go quiet and stuck in my mind kinda of and of course paranoid but it just made music and gaming fun but I‚Äôve stopped now.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "Backstory:  \nI would like to tell you a little bit about myself so you can get to know me better. I‚Äôm an ordinary young person living in Turkey. I'm an Agnostic. I had a difficult childhood. I was raised by indifferent parents. I‚Äôve been through various things that I don‚Äôt want to talk about. Since my childhood, I‚Äôve been trying to earn my mother‚Äôs and father‚Äôs respect and get praise from them, but even though I‚Äôm 22 years old, I haven‚Äôt been able to achieve this. Now, I don‚Äôt care about it anymore. (At least, I think I don‚Äôt care.) When I was sick, my family made me feel like I was a burden to them, and they talked about how I caused them financial trouble. I‚Äôm 160 cm tall and weigh 53 kg, I faced a lot of difficulties in school and wasn‚Äôt taken seriously because of my short stature. Until high school, I was even shy about socializing with people. In high school, I would switch from one character to another in order to be accepted by people, and even if I was treated badly, I would try very hard not to lose those people because the number of people I talked to was limited. After finishing high school, I didn‚Äôt go to university, and instead, I started focusing on developing myself. My parents behavior towards me created a sense of ambition and drive within me.\n\nToday:  \nNowadays, I don‚Äôt talk to my family, but I have enough money to live on my own and buy anything I want. I participate in various social events, I smile every second, I treat people well, and I‚Äôm a more social person. However, the problem is that despite all this smiling and confidence, there are nights when I cry, and all I want is for someone to stroke my head or hug me. I want to meet up with a friend and talk to them every minute, and sometimes this can overwhelm the person I‚Äôm with. But unless I‚Äôm having face-to-face communication with someone, it doesn‚Äôt feel like a real connection. I always want more love, and no matter how much love I receive, it still feels insufficient. Also, no matter what I do, I can‚Äôt enjoy anything. My brain has started working in a materialistic way. Every time, I feel the urge to achieve some concrete success. Sometimes I feel like I can accomplish anything, but at other times, I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to achieve anything. Sometimes I make plans to meet up with my friends, but immediately afterward, I regret it and don‚Äôt want to go anymore. Also, I want to trust every smiling person. Even if there‚Äôs a chance they might hurt me, I want to believe they are a good person and give them a chance. I also daydream a lot, and sometimes I get so caught up in these fantasies that when I imagine myself shouting, there are times when I unconsciously move my mouth. What is my problem?\n\nNOTE: I do not use any medication or drugs. I am far away from such things.",

I just want my parents to know i‚Äôm trying, and that I love them and I want them to love me back. I forgive them for what they‚Äôve said and done to me.

I only do everything else around here as far as maintenance and bills and cooking and outside work and working on the cars when needed and making sure the dogs are cared for and our laundry, now she wants to do something and it's worthless.

But those earlier years still haunt me.\nI often felt paralyzed during their fights, terrified for my mom and afraid of making things worse. I'd even try to \"help\" her by telling her what not to do to avoid setting him off, which I now realize wasn't fair. She probably wasn't in a good place mentally either.\n\nAt school, I struggled a lot-fighting with teachers, refusing to learn, and even being sent to a psychologist, though I never told them anything.\n\nNow, I'm 19, and think I have dysthymia, and have been on antidepressants for six months. I struggle with motivation and feel \"lazy,\" which frustrates me, also have a social anxiety in certain situations. Could my childhood experiences be the reason?

Things are new then, you can dream, hope, and with that you can give your life meaning because you are naive enough to be able to do that.

I‚Äôve been on medication and it made me feel completely numb, and my therapist is the one who prescribed it to me. I‚Äôve struggled with anorexia and that adds up to this. \nI cry every day alone in my room when I have to act like I‚Äôm okay and happy around the people I‚Äôm with.\n\nYesterday was especially hard because it was Thanksgiving and I had to force a smile on my face around the people I love knowing what‚Äôs really going on in my head. When I got home from Thanksgiving, I cried in my moms arms, begging her to hug me and she didn‚Äôt know that I tried to take my life the day before until I told her because I never leave my room unless I work. At that point I felt so bad for the times I treated my mom poorly just because I wanted her to see that I do need help. She left for a trip and I feel as if she‚Äôs the only one who can help me but now I‚Äôm alone and I feel so empty, I just want someone to hug me. She told my dad who was never in my life that I had attempted and he finally decided to break no-contact after years. It made me realize he only cares when it‚Äôs too late.\n\nI‚Äôve told my best friend but she disregards what I say because she is busy with her own life and mental health so I don‚Äôt want to be a burden. I just want someone to help me because I can‚Äôt help myself.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I want all the pain and thinking to go away but no matter how much I try to distract myself, when I‚Äôm alone in my room, I can‚Äôt help but look at what life could be without me. \nI have a dead-end job, I live with my mom, I have no friends who I feel like genuinely like me and I usually have to pay for them when we go out so it feels like I pay for friends, I have no love life, I feel like I have no future. I had to get an animal to hold me accountable for living and she is the only thing that‚Äôs keeping me here. \n\nI can‚Äôt stop crying at the end of the day when I‚Äôm alone. I tried to do things that made me happy but I don‚Äôt see life the way it used to be before my mental health got so bad. I‚Äôve always implied I needed help to my friends but they always thought it was a joke because I always make them laugh. I really can‚Äôt do this any more",

Bond with others, it doesn‚Äôt matter who these people are, but make sure they make you happy. Make sure they like you back, surround yourself with others. Life may seem shit now, I can‚Äôt promise it will get better, I can only give you my support. Keep soldiering on, stay strong man. Good luck."

He then gives me the silent treatment, leaves, goes for an angry drive in the car, comes back, trys to explain for a moment, but is still upset, shouting sometimes. Then, sometimes goes through this thing where he just yells and screams, talks about wanting the courage to 'do it' aka suicide, then eventually starts crying in a very dramatic way, calls himself a terrible person, how he hates himself etc etc. Then he always comes around says he's sorry wants a hug etc. The whole process takes a while and varies a bit. For example, once or twice he clearly used talk of suicide to try and get my attention (said he walked down to 'the spot', which he didn't). sometimes curls up in a ball, sometimes hits himself on the head.\n\nI guess what i'm asking is are these typically symptoms of people who have a mix of depression/anger? Or is it more likely something deeper? I know no one can give me a real answer, i'm just thinking aloud I guess. He sees a therapist, but it's not helping much, he's currently unemployed and has never been happy with work, has been having these outbursts in various.\n\nI'm asking because i'm trapped... not happy in the relationship because of this, triggering a lot of mental health issues for me, but also, he's very dependent on me for everything, so if we split it will only send him into a much deeper unhealthy spot....\n\nObviously i don't expect anyone to have an answer for me, just wondering if this sort of pattern/symptoms is familiar to anyone.",

Even though i feel fishy about it, i let it be and have complete faith. But no matter what i do i just feel miserable overthinking about her. Whether she might have a new bf or just doesn't love me anymore. Now i feel more shitty because no matter what i do recently, it all went to shit. Try to land a job is one hard thing to do. I tried to post content on Tiktok cause i thought i might be able to get some money, but got low view count. \n\nNow i just feel like a failure and nobody. Then, just the final touch to make me feel shittier than i ever could. Seeing my highschool classmates have a bunch reunion and took pic together. Everyone except me left out, an outcast. Every night i thought to myself and wonder, I have no one that loves me and no one to talk to. ",

No therapy has ever helped so I give up on therapy. I give up on wasting everyone‚Äôs time and money for something that doesn‚Äôt do any good for me. I‚Äôm not in it to help myself. I‚Äôm in it to get shit off my chest cause I can‚Äôt bring it up to anyone I care about. So lately. I‚Äôve just been going about my day and acting like I‚Äôm fine. Like I‚Äôm not dying. Or dreading life. Like I‚Äôm not lonely or depressed. Like I‚Äôm not wanting to die at all. I just have this mask that no one sees past cause no one really cares. And I truly believe no one actually cares about me. Cause peioke who care talk to the people they care about. They don‚Äôt leave them on delivered all day. Or leave them on read. They reach out first. They sends well wishes on holidays. But no one does that for me. I wished a friend happy thanksgiving yesterfsy and they didn‚Äôt even say it back. I got no texts from anyone else with the wishes. I got left on read wishing another person happy thanksgiving. So honestly. I‚Äôm really honing on: ‚Äú2025 is the year the I give up on social life‚Äù. Where I don‚Äôt have any close friends. Where I don‚Äôt text first. Where I stop going out. I stop trying. I stop texting I stop calling. I get cold. And no one will fucking care one iota. And I‚Äôm doing it cause I know I can get away with it. I know I can force myself to die alone. I think maybe being alone is better than being with people who dont actually care. I‚Äôm done feeling lied to. I‚Äôm done with the empty promises. The rejection. If anyone wants me. They need to pursue me. 2025 I‚Äôm changing myself. Possibly gonna starve myself. Possibly gonna become even more fat. Gonna try to go to the gym more often. It‚Äôs a mixture of self care and isolation. But like. Yeah. I give up on my relationships. It‚Äôs clear no one‚Äôs actually stay so why even bother trying to keep them?"

In general, I will speak based on my experience only. During the pandemic, I was very inactive, and when I returned to study, I noticed a significant decline in my mental abilities to the point that I feared that my brain had broken down. It is good that the brain is sufficiently stabilised to adapt and repair itself. Think of it as an athlete who stopped practicing for years and then returned. He will feel that he lost a lot, but with persistence and exercise, he may return to what he was. If your brain becomes weaker in certain matters, exercise it. For example, if you find yourself bad at memorising and remembering, allocate an hour a day to practicing memory exercises. By the way, you write much better than the impression you describe seems!"

He is living on some bonds he cashed as well as his remaining sick days. It pains me to say that he is not the same person he used to be and he has admitted as much to me saying he no longer enjoys talking to me and joking about our shared interests. \n\nEvery conversation now is him reaching out to vent about he has spent the day crying, how he feels so sad and without joy, how he feels he blew up his life, how he now regrets quitting the new teaching job because it made a hole in his resume, and how scared he is that he will never be the old version of himself again. \n\nHe has been going to therapy and has been prescribed several depression medications since this all started, but he says none of it makes him feel better. All the people in his life (myself included) have continually encouraged him and empathized with him, but everything we say seems to go in one ear and out the other. \n\nI went through a deep depression last year and I understand how it can warp your perspective, but I'm at a point where I don't know what else I can say or do to help him.

It's hard to let go though, since it's the only place where I feel understood, but by staying, I know we're all enabling each other's struggles, idk what to do.\n\nThen I just look in the mirror and wonder \"Did I invade this poor person's soul, did I hurt them?\" My thoughts are absolutely scattered. A cocktail of cognitive dissonance, detachment and self-deception.\n\nAlso after 29 days of no self-harm, I did it yesterday. It seems people like me don't make it to adulthood, but I don't want to accept that.\n\nAnd I have such self-hatred, I kind of feel inhumane, because I mostly know what's wrong, but I'm powerless to do anything about it. Mostly because I have no support or financial means to do so, but not everyone has that you know, I should be able to do something at least.\n\nI can't distract myself anymore, there's no more comfort or escape.

I have weird episodes at least one time per week where I feel completely hopeless, sad and I spiral into despair and panic attacks even for apparent no real reason. I even feel physically exhausted, heavy and have physical pain (headaches, stomachaches...). It's hard to describe, like as if something clicks in my mind and suddenly my mood is at the lowest point ever with a lot of scary thoughts. As if the world suddenly loses all colour. It's a horrible sensation but since it happens not every day and I have a pretty normal life (I work, have social life, a partner...) I have no idea if it's actually a mental health problem or just a thing that happens normally and I should simply get over it? \n\nNobody in my life knows about this. I don't want to worry them or scary them and I am not so sure about asking a professional about this because of money problems as well. But I am also afraid that it might get worse if I ignore it, especially considering that I have a person in my family with mental health issues. \n\nNow, my question is: is it normal to feel like this? I don't understand if it's just me being a weak drama queen or if it's seriously something that should require assistance. I also feel guilty about this because I have a very nice life and I am so grateful for it, there is no bigger problem that would justify this. What do you think? ",

You're trying to help, but understand this makes me 100x worse. I KNOW I have to look forward, that's why I'm suicidal. I dewll on the past because there's no point in looking twords my future. I don't wanna gain my independence, I don't wanna be all alone, I don't wanna be an adult, and get a partner, and such, I want someone to care for me and hold me and care for me and parent me and tell me everything's gonna be okay like when I was little, but because I'm older I don't fucking get that.\n\nAnother thing I overthinking about is how my parents would always constantly brush aside my issues by telling me their problems were worse than mine, because their parents were neglectful and pretty physically abusive (for my father they were physically abusive, at least). I know it's good to recognize my parents tried to make my life better and set aside their past, but, a lot of people don't understand how much that has literally fucked me and my brother up mentally. It caused both of us to envy abuse to an unhealthy extent and always think our problems are more miniscule than we think, both of us resorting to getting into self harm to cope with that feeling of unsuperiority and weakness. Unfortunately I still struggle with my self harm addictions today, but I'm starting to get better and do it less, ignoring my slip-up last month. My mother is helping more, she's making more of an effort to help support my mental health, which I'm very grateful for, but sometimes I will say the constant feeling of being weak and unsuperior will constantly linger within me. I know what I think is selfish. I hate how I think. I honestly don't know how else to vent my frustrations. I always turn to my coping mechanisms and addictions to help with my overthinking and depression. I know it's counterproductive to turn to coping and having a younger, less mature mindset, I know, you don't have to tell me, but that's the thing, I don't wanna move forward in life. I wanna stay 15 forever. Hell, I'd stay 5 forever if I could, so my dependency and need for so much love and reassurance could be justified and I don't have to constantly be told I'm too old, or feel like a total embarrassment. I hate my obsessiveness. I hate my dependency. I wish I was just born normal, and I could actually look forward to my life in the future, but I can't even think about next week without having a mental breakdown and getting pissed off. I'm just barely getting through each day. I don't know who else to talk to about these issues. I fucking hate it when people tell me things like what I think isn't productive. I know. I'm not trying to be productive, I'm trying to be fucking happy for once, because I'm NOT HAPPY. I'm MISERABLE. I need something to ACTUALLY effectively make me happy, because nothing does. I don't wanna be blamed for clinging onto comfort and things that make me happy. I didn't ask to be born into this life, in just trying so, so hard to at least somewhat enjoy my time on earth, which I'm just waiting to run out. I can't even get up and properly clean myself, or eat, or sleep, I'm MISERABLE and NEED this childlike mindset to cope, it's the only thing that subsides these torturous thoughts and my constant raincloud over my head. My brother's asleep, so I can't talk to him right now, and I can't just...sit, and let these thoughts linger, that just causes me to resort to bruising myself again to help the thoughts. I hope y'all don't mind this rant. I'm feeling so many emotions right now, and I just need to voice this to...someone.\n\nI'm thinking about therapy, but I'm also scared of it. My parents hate therapy, they say it doesn't work. I also always heard venting certain issues such as self harm and such can get me locked in an asylum, or some shit like that. Plus my overall distrust of people in general.\n\nJesus Christ, this is so much, I know, my thoughts are just going a million miles an hour, I'm thinking of 100 different things per second while writing this. If you've read the full post to this point, holy shit, I thank you so much for actually taking the time to listen to my bullshit and scrambled thoughts.",

They still live in the house I grew up in, and it‚Äôs feeling really weird to come back to my old room. When I was in college and came home for breaks, I remember it was comforting to have this familiar space to come back to, a space that gave me that feeling of stability and coziness that dorm life never could. \n\nNow, it just feels kind of‚Ä¶ eerie. I was once a baby in this room. My parents read me picture books on a couch in the corner where my bed now is. I spent hundreds of hours in here playing with various toys, hundreds more lying awake at night as a teenager, thinking about crushes and colleges to consider and ideas for novels I swore I‚Äôd write someday. This is where I thought up so, so many hopes and dreams for my future, from big crazy things like maybe making it to Broadway with an original play, to silly teenager things like fooling around with a classmate in a friends-to-lovers sort of scenario (surprise, never happened). \n\nAnd now? I‚Äôm a different person. I don‚Äôt aspire to be anyone, I don‚Äôt crave intimacy with others. I don‚Äôt have any hopes and dreams. These walls once saw ambition in my eyes, and now I‚Äôm just empty, unmotivated, and uninterested in most things, especially things that would be good for me.\n\nI wish I could go back to being the kid who felt like this room was their sanctuary. Instead, I just feel reminded of how much my personality, mental health, and worldview have changed for the worse. And it doesn‚Äôt feel like home. And neither does my apartment 600 miles away.",

Another thing is finding the root of your problems, see what is causing these things to happen in your life, once you‚Äôve found that, try to tweak or change the issues while taking it slow.\nAsk me if you need any more advice!"

I am constantly living with guilt and feeling lost in life. As well as having the same intrusive thoughts everyday, which makes it hard to function. I have been in therapy for the past couple weeks and found out that I have mild depression, which was not a surprise. Therapy has helped me gain a little hope that things will get better and to change my mindset to focus on the good things, rather than the bad. I won‚Äôt get into everything because it is a lot and I think you get the picture.\n\nAnyways, I have made the decision multiples times to prioritize my mental health. I try to engage in activities that I enjoy, like thrifting. I know that my thoughts are just thoughts and I try not to respond to them. I will do good most of the day, especially when I am focused on doing something. However, there will be periods (typically at night) where the guilt comes back and makes me feel as though I am not making any progress with my mental health. This is mainly because I notice that the intrusive thoughts are still wandering in my mind. It makes me feel like I am back at square one and I can‚Äôt help but think that I am ‚Äúwasting my time‚Äù and not healing from my past.\n\nI guess I am looking for advice on how to stay positive even when I have bad moments throughout the day. How do I not react to the thoughts, even though I notice they are there?\n\nThanks for any advice!!",

        "text": "I'm not usually the biggest fan of discussing my feelings with others, but therapists in the past have suggested journaling as a way to work through my feelings- I'm hoping you all don't mind me doing so here.\n\n  \nI'm having a really rough night tonight, for a couple of different reasons.\n\nSome background- I'm a 33 year old man who has depression and an anxiety disorder, I take daily medication for both, which does help.\n\nMy family came by today for Thanksgiving which was great-  we watched some movies and played a board game-- good times!  \n  \nMy mom also brought a box of old school stuff that she kept- my highschool diploma, a bunch of newspaper clippings that I was in, old report cards and awards. When I went through this stuff, I just started bawling my eyes out. Seeing all these old awards and accomplishments just made me feel like I'm such a huge failure now--made me feel like I used to be great but that I'm broken and worthless now.\n\nI'm mad at myself for feeling this way- I feel so stupid. I shouldn't need external validation from others to appreciate myself. It's not like your boss is going to give you a 1st place ribbon like elementary school- lol. I should love myself and have self-esteem based on who I am as a person, I shouldn't need someone else to tell me my worth- and I'm so frustrated at myself for this. Why can't I see my own value and take pride in that anymore?\n\n  \nMy mom's a great person, and gave me hugs and helped talk me through my feelings of failure tonight, but when she left to go home I just collapsed on the floor sobbing again. I guess I didn't realize how much I missed them until I saw them tonight. My mom has pets and I'm very allergic-- even when I take two different allergy meds I can only be around the house for about an hour before it becomes unbearable for me-- so I really don't get to go visit her at all- I haven't seen them since my birthday in Sept. I've had this conversation with her and given her a key to my house-- tried to do all I can to make sure they know they're welcome here anytime and that I'd love to see them, but it's really only holidays that she takes me up on that. Getting rid of the pets isn't a possible solution-- my mom deserves to have companionship and its my fault that I'm allergic, not hers.\n\nI also feel stupid at myself for throwing a temper tantrum tonight like a fucking toddler. I went to turn on the sink to wash dishes after pulling myself together a bit, but the knob for the sink shattered in my hands. I lashed out destructively and hit my fridge-- breaking a fridge magnet that a friend bought for me. This just made me feel like a huge piece of shit. I'm a 30 year old man who can't process his own damn emotions well enough to not break something. It makes me feel like my father, when he would come home from deployment and hit me because he couldn't work through his feelings either.\n\nI know I'm going to process these emotions and end up okay, but man does it suck tonight. Thanks for listening to me vent.",

How weird how we now praise pain for beauty yet never seem to notice its scars only blinded by the growth it can start. How weird that you tire yourself to fit perfectly in a box not made for your lows. How weird that we pretend were all fine, to only see the highs at our lowest, to forget our low at our highest. What is life but a game of dress up, pick the best clothes, the best brands always talk louder, cover your bruise, cover your scars, cover your tears, cover the things that make you human, make yourself complacent yet unique, loud yet proper, yourself yet enough to stop people from staring and wondering, how can you be so improper? What is life but a game of strength, suffer in silence, cry in silence, turn a blind eye to the flaws of others while focused on the flaws you carry. What is life but a stage for all, be the best to act, stand out while being on script, dress up, for your inner self must not shine through, only when needed to make pain a beauty to behold, what is life but an act, to smile when were sad, to cry when were strong, to shout when were in control, to fear when we have no control, to dance to the music of life, unsure when it ends or how it plays, to fall gracefully when were in pain, to make mistake seem beautiful to the audience, What is life when we see the world as black and white knowing its all gray, when we see it as something so divine and holy yet ignore the flaws and the gore, don‚Äôt wake up, don‚Äôt realize the blood and the flaws, fall in line and don‚Äôt fight, just smile even when your scars start to bleed. What is life but a cage, when freedom is a construct, when society is wrong yet praised, when people divide for reasons, we cannot stop. You‚Äôre in control right?

I get sad every so often, and when I do it‚Äôs very strong, but it never lasts for long periods of time like before. Plus I‚Äôm still able to hang out with friends and family and function just well enough where it looks like I‚Äôm just a shitty student rather than a student that needs help, which is pretty annoying.\n\nI‚Äôve just been so tired (both physically & mentally) and so low energy, and I just want to be able to do things again, especially because I don‚Äôt want to drag other people down with me. I feel like I‚Äôm disappointing people or coming across as disinterested when in reality I just don‚Äôt have the energy to do anything. It feels like it takes so much out of me to do basic things, and I know the excuse of ‚ÄúI just physically can‚Äôt‚Äù can only be used so much before people around me begin to get annoyed, which I completely understand because if I were dating someone & all of a sudden they didn‚Äôt want to do anything anymore I might get fed up too but idk! I just want to do things! Everything just feels like so much effort & that‚Äôs pretty lame!!!!!\n\nIf anyone has any advice or relates please let me know!! I‚Äôd love to hear from you :)\n\n- theofficialgarfield",

So, I prefer to sleep early these days, otherwise I am a night owl. \n\nI wanted to let it all out, talk to people, getting myself back on track, but the fear of judgement always makes me feel that I have to deal this alone. That's when I turned to alcohol, it has been a great friend. But now that I think of it, it feels like alcohol is like that friend which has over stayed it's time and the longer it stays, the more it makes it difficult for me to focus on my things. One of the main reason I turned to alcohol was because I know that I cannot open up to people when I am sober. Also, another reason is alcohol helps in embracing the mood you are in, encouraging the true self of yours to come out and lately I kind of find joy in being sad. That's when I decided to get sober up, and today I am one day sober, and it's my second day today. I also smoke quite a lot, I am planning to quit, but let's be honest, one thing at a time. So, for starters I'll cut it down, and eventually I'll try to quit. \n\nI have found myself cannot connect to the people around me, and kind of feel like I am better off without them and vice versa. I do not want to spoil anyone's mood. Furthermore, I also observed that I overthink a lot on a minimal thing these days, before on which I said fuck it and moved on. I try to stay humble, but now I have found myself to be this selfish kind of person, I do not know why, or maybe I do? Just that I do not want to realize it. \n\nI have stopped looking for answers for things that are bothering me, because deep down I know the answers, I am just in deniable stage. \n\nThe good part of depression is embracing nature, enjoying it. I like to see sunrise, sunsets, beautiful scenery, and now I really do that a lot. I know time will heal me, just like before, I have found myself in the worst stage, but I got out eventually, and this time also, but I think it would have been better if I had someone to talk to, just listening to me, providing validation, because the answers I already know, I just want someone who can sit with me and say that it's normal what you are feeling, and you'll get over it.\n",

        "text": "So around 1 year ago I started feeling really low mood all the time. It slowly got worse and worse until I got a therapist. I enjoyed talking to her but overall it didn‚Äôt help much and as soon as the 12 weeks was over I fell back down within like a month. During this time I‚Äôd been having boy drama which made this even worse since my self esteem was on THE FLOOR. \n\nI tried >!self harm!< by >!burning!< which kinda helped but wasn‚Äôt completely for me. I still did it around once/twice a week tho for a few months and have the ugly >!scars!< still. I hate how they look. \n\n3/4 times if I was super upset I would go downstairs and have some of my parents \n>!beer!<, one time even tried >!vodka!< but couldn‚Äôt get myself to swallow it. I never got \n>!drunk!< tho since I hate the taste of >!alcohol!< I haven‚Äôt done this in a while though.\n\nSome of my friends >!vape!< and I‚Äôve tried this as well before. Not a lot though literally just like 2/3 times. \n\n And then there‚Äôs my severe >!insecurities!< and how I restrict my food intake and all. I obsessively >!count calories!< and restrict my >!consumption to MAX 1200!< a day, but honestly it‚Äôs night right now and I >!haven‚Äôt eaten!< all day. \n\nOh yeah I‚Äôve also >!cut!< but not bad AT ALL like literally once or twice and it barely >!grazed!< me no >!scars!< . \n\nI used to have a friend group of 5 and had other friends, but now it‚Äôs mainly just me and my best friend. One of my friends is still hangs out with me but also hangs out and games with some boys that talk so bad about me and my friends. They literally started joking about how they wanted to report (fake report) my best friend and ruin her social life and make her cry. \n\nThose boys talk so bad about us and try to get me to say >!homophobic!< and >!racist!< stuff just because they know I won‚Äôt. Then they act annoyed when I don‚Äôt. I know I should ignore them - they‚Äôre not even popular anyways - but it gets to me. A LOT.\nAnd, funnily enough, one of them actually asked me out a while back and I said no, and now he hates me. \n\nWhat else?\n\nOh, also I feel like I‚Äôm failing every class I‚Äôm in. I know I‚Äôm not but I get so stressed out when we have a test and feel so worthless if I don‚Äôt get a good score, or one of my friends gets above me. Obv I still feel happy for them but I‚Äôm also devastated at the same time. All my family are academics, businessmen or doctors, and I feel so out of place. Like I‚Äôm not smart enough to be loved. \n\nAlso, I used to be the best at sports of my year BY FAR. Especially in the track. Now I‚Äôve fallen off and am still really good but not the best, and it‚Äôs the worst. \n\nI go to the gym every day now just to get better, and I know I should >!eat more!< if I want to truly improve really fast, so I eat really >!low calorie!< protein bars, but am also so scared of >!gaining weight!< that it holds me back. I wake up at 5am to get ready and study, then study for around 1.5hrs when I get home, yet I still feel so stupid. \n\nOh, as well as this, I was >!sexually assaulted!< a few months ago and this has made me extremely uncomfortable in public, especially with middle aged scruffy men, and any men really who I don‚Äôt know really. I get super >!hyper vigilant!< around phones due to fear of >!creep shots!<, and always want to \n>!cover up my body!< . It doesn‚Äôt help that people in my school treat >!rape!< and >!sexual assault!< as a joke. \n\nAnyways, there‚Äôs probably not I just cant remember it rn. Thanks for listening to my little rant haha. Ik it probably all sounds stupid and you might be thinking ‚Äòwhy does she even care?‚Äô Or ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt important I don‚Äôt get it.‚Äô Me neither lol\n\nI hate being a teen girl xx\n\n",

        "text": "For all those like me who need to hear it: Choosing to be kind is one of the hardest choices to make, but also one of the most powerful. It shows that we are stronger than those who choose to act out of indifference or selfishness. By deciding to be kind, we accept becoming vulnerable and risking being used. But within this vulnerability lies immense strength, because by choosing to reach out, to give our hearts, we offer the world something precious: the possibility to change, to heal, and to touch lives. People with big hearts possess a rare power ‚Äî the power to make a difference. ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility.‚Äù This principle applies to all of us. If we have the power to spread kindness and offer help, even when the other doesn‚Äôt seem to deserve it, it is our responsibility to do so. This is what makes the world more humane. If you wonder what your purpose in this world is, the answer is simple: to offer kindness. Kind people are the ones who hold one of the most important places in this world. They are the ones who create authentic connections, heal the invisible wounds of others, and shape a fairer and more humane future. Never forget that.",

My studies since then have been disastrous, there is a subject I have repeated 7 times, but I have failed 4 semesters and have only passed 2 subjects during these years, at least I know that I am not stupid as I finished my first academic year at university with an excellent grade, but now I am close to being expelled, despite the huge financial and life losses I cannot make any effort as if I am running a marathon with broken feet. Everything I have tried to do has failed in the face of this loop and during the current sensitive period it does not seem that I am able to change and control things, as my life is like a repetition of everything that used to happen from bad and long sleep and a miserable psychological state, postponement of exams and bad studying followed by lack of concentration, there is a defect in my mind and I do not have the slightest idea on how to overcome it.\nI am stuck between dreams, ambitions like all humans, and my mind and body that refuse to make any effort or change.",

I am 19 years old, I am a girl, I have been an emotional person all my life, it all started at the age of 8, when my mother started beating me, which later led to the fear of being at home. at the age of 12, I already started walking in companies, and at the age of 14, they tried to rape me, which finally broke me. then I had suicide attempts , but all 3 times I was saved, so to speak, I cut myself and tried to swallow pills . at almost 16 years old, I met my love and for 1.5 years I completely forgot about all the problems because he became everything to me, but all this turned into a wild dependence on a person. I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, prescribed pills and sent home. at first everything was fine, but then abruptly I started to get covered. perhaps due to the relationship, we've been together for 3.5 years, and I don't want him, he disgusts me, but I can't imagine life without him, as soon as we talk about breaking up, I have panic attacks and so on up to 8 times a day. It's hard for me to get out of bed , I want to fall asleep and not wake up . I started smoking marijuana with a friend, this is now the only moment that I like. I catch creepy panic attacks... just wild ones. I don't have enough communication‚Ä¶ I really want to learn English to the perfect level, but I barely have the strength to get out of bed, I don't eat anything... I had thoughts of suicide again. On the 18th, I go to the psychiatrist again, but I live in Latvia and our doctors like to just prescribe the first pills they come across and let them go, I'm afraid to drink antidepressants, + mom says that I came up with everything so that I wouldn't embarrass the family‚Ä¶ I feel very bad ...\nI can't sleep , I have nightmares, I'm tormented by thoughts about relationships, my whole condition is tormenting\n",

However, despite mainly some social and friendship issue I have had, the later half of middle school up to high school were great. Grades always spotless, had that gifted kid syndrome for sure. Then after my extremely carefree summer after senior year I felt into the darkest depression ever. I felt like I was losing my mind, barely took care of myself extremely spotty on when to stop studying or some days procrastinate endlessly. I went to a giant state school and realised after my freshmen year I needed to go back.\n\nI now go to a local 4 year college changed my major and I am 100% happier than before but now I feel like squidward. Everyday at college seems to blend together and Im not working toward anything I want anymore. I just want that spark I had from middle school to high school again. I did do a ton of pot from senior year to freshmen year of college to cope but now I have cut that off and a lot of other unhealthy habits like social media. I also would take SNRIs but lately I have felt like an emotionless husk so due to the advice of my psyciatrist I stopped taking them. \n\nI have tried using my colleges mental health services but I don't feel like I improve from them frankly worse as my last meeting I ended up crying like crazy.\nI just want to know how can I tackle this new more personal counselor group to actually change? They have a focus on goal oriention which seems right.up my alley.",

All it has done is made it worse, I'm now deep in the trenches of a nihilist/ existential dread, despite how stupid it really is. It feels like I can see what I want to do, I know exactly what‚Äôs wrong and how to fix it, but inside my mind there is a shadow that whispers a simple message , ‚Äúit‚Äôs pointless, what reason do you have for doing this work?‚Äù No matter what I argue it has no effect, god? Is he truly existing?What proof do you have that isn‚Äôt just confirmation bias? Oh you think your purpose is to become rich and well known? Well, how is it any different to your situation now? You might have more money, but what will you do with so much money? Indulge in your desires. Instead of working so hard toward a future where you do the same, why not just indulge in desires now and eventually die off in the same way I would if I was rich.  I can‚Äôt argue anything without finding a fault in my own reasoning, the fortress of nihilism seems almost impossible to  defeat. I‚Äôm lost and purposeless, and can‚Äôt seem to find anything that sticks. \n\nTo move my body parts requires me to act against the cell‚Äôs will to remain immobile and not waste energy, so moving my arm, leg, walking, or doing anything requires my brain to overpower the will of my cells. I thought that similarly to move forward in life one must overpower all other wills in their brain. \n\nA paralysed person can‚Äôt communicate or have any influence over their cells, and are thus immobile, if the same applies, then maybe I can‚Äôt do anything at all because my will or whatever will I throw at nihilism has no effect. I‚Äôm mentally paralysed, I can‚Äôt do anything I really want to and instead just waste time indulging in primal desires as my life falls apart before it even truly begins. \n\nDoes anyone else feel similarly? And if so, do you have any tips, like maybe my mind is putting a cage over myself or something?",

I have no motivation but I also know that there will never be motivation to walk, I just need to get up and go outside. I live in a small town and when I go outside I just see cars, it seems that everybody is using cars. Exercise would be benefical for my depression but It is just not easy to go out and walk. I am wondering how others can walk every day. I have this depression and I just want not to have it, I know this is what everybody wants. I have also therapy and doing CBT, plus I read a lot about it. It is just so difficult. Do you do exercise? Walk or something else? At the moment my depression is so severe that I can not work. When I do something I get very tired and need to sit down and wait. When I go out for a walk I can feel its benefits but I can not imagine myself to have that discipline to go out every single day.",

For a while I could only walk from room to room in my home so I would start with small goals like 500 steps per day. I gradually built up to 1000 steps and then made the swap to walking outside.\n\nAt first, I was limited to only walking up and down my road but over several weeks, I started to build up to going around one block and so on, and so on...\n\nI had many bad days where I couldn't match my previous steps but I just eased back and tried again the next day or the next day....\n\nFast forward to the present. I now run approximately 100 miles per month and it's changed my whole outlook on life.\n\nStart real small if you feel you can. Even 100 steps per day counts as a start on the journey. Can't leave the house due to anxiety? Walk around the house instead and take a seat if it gets to be too much. Take a breather and do another 100 steps of you can. If not, that's ok too.\n\nNever be too hard on yourself if it doesn't come together immediately and allow yourself room for failure days. If you fail, that's ok. Try again the next day and I promise you'll start to see benefits.\n\nWishing you the best of luck and sending motivation you way."

I give up on everything I‚Äôve ever tried to do to better myself. since I grew up, life feels like one ironic fucking setback after another. I can‚Äôt quit, and the truth is, I don‚Äôt even know if I want to. Not really. I used to be a good student, and now I‚Äôm failing a fucking college class because I forgot to submit an essay. I used to be a nice kid, but I took a step back and realized I‚Äôm a douchebag asshole. Not just to my family, but to everybody. I want to be religious but I feel myself straying away and having more and more doubts if we‚Äôre not all wrong about what religion really is, and I can‚Äôt bring myself to pray and lie to myself. I sit and wonder what the purpose of life is, and I know the answer. There is no grand purpose for life. Nothing you do will ever matter, because we were never really here. Live, die, nothing will change either way. In the grand scheme of things, you were never really here. We exist on a rock in the middle of nowhere and have kidded ourselves into thinking life means something. In thr absence of religion, life has no external purpose. You have to give your own life purpose, that‚Äôs the answer. I‚Äôm finding that really fucking hard right now. Purpose is found in others, and being needed by people. I‚Äôm not the person everyone thinks I am. I don‚Äôt really exist. I‚Äôm just another face, and I‚Äôve lost whatever used to be behind it. I‚Äôm not suicidal, but I wonder why I should even try? Why not just become an alcoholic and feel good while I burn out? I have fun now by being around friends, but we will go our separate ways after graduation, regardless of what we say now. We will drift apart and in a few years, we will just be vague memories in each others lives. Happiness is an illusion, and it‚Äôs temporary. I have no ambitions because I have nothing to be ambitious for. I am going to have nothing to come home to accept an empty space full of the echos of what I could have been. My parents always tell me I could be whatever I want to be, and I suppose it‚Äôs true. If I try hard enough, I can do basically anything I‚Äôve ever tried to do. I just have to study. But what‚Äôs the fucking point? I don‚Äôt want to be some bullshit accountant, or whatever job makes the most money now. I pissed away the opportunities I had, and in a few years I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to regret not making more of myself because life is going to be hard. It‚Äôs hard to write in words how I feel. Everything all feels pointless. Life isn‚Äôt ever perfect, and that‚Äôs what we strive for in the end. It‚Äôs perfection. I‚Äôm 17 and my life feels like a massive fucking trainwreck that I don‚Äôt want to fix, because I don‚Äôt have a reason. I sound like a whiny little bitch, but I don‚Äôt care. I just want to give up and crash out and burn, just give up and succumb to whatever I feel like doing. But the worst part is, I‚Äôm not going to, not in the sense I give up control and enjoy the ride down. I‚Äôm going to feign being in charge of what happens to me but really I‚Äôm not doing shit because I‚Äôm not trying, and I‚Äôm going to crash, and bring everything I have down with me in the process. I‚Äôm goi g to ruin my life and be just like the people who never amounted to anything I was warned about as a kid. \n\nFinding a point is stupid anyways. Nobody fucking cares, not that much. People think they care about you because society tells them to. If humans lived the way they were intended, I‚Äôd be dead already. My mother would have abandoned me for being a defective fucking baby. In the absence of religion I‚Äôm finding that this existence is bleak and useless. I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if anything is real. It seams like nothing we do is genuine, and even if we think it is, it fails by our own definition because nothing in perfect. That‚Äôs life, but then again, what is life? Life is existing for a while, then ceasing to exist. When you stop existing, everything you ever did ceases to matter to you, and that‚Äôs what matters to you. In order to find purpose, you have to tell yourself that what you do will matter to those around you after your gone. The. they die, and it was like you never existed in the first place. \n\nThis is a long way of saying that I am lost. I feel stuck, like I‚Äôm stuck in a river rapid pushing me forward but I‚Äôm trying to hold on and say where I am.  Life‚Äôs pushing me forward and I‚Äôm not ready to go because I‚Äôm not ready for life yet, because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm fighting for. I‚Äôm lost, and I fear I‚Äôve lost the thing that made me myself forever. I wonder if I‚Äôm slightly sociopathic. \n\nThen again, nobody gives a fuck. I‚Äôm just another teenager who swears he‚Äôs different than the rest on whining assholes who go through the same thing. Life is stupid, and I‚Äôm already getting sick of it. If a car crashed into me tomorrow and killed me, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd care that much. This might sound like a complaining teenager who thinks the world is against him and he‚Äôs so depressed and alone, but I really don‚Äôt care. Fuck you all for saying life gets better. Life‚Äôs been on a steady decline since I hit age 11 and discovered porn and reality exist, and it won‚Äôt get any better unless I start lying to myself about purpose, which I don‚Äôt care enough to do. \n\nand the worst fucking part is, tomorrow I‚Äôm going to wake up and talk about my future with my mom. I‚Äôm going to talk to a counselor about which college I want to go to. I‚Äôm going to work in school and get A‚Äôs and graduate as a part of the honor society, if I haven‚Äôt blown that chance. I‚Äôm going to do exsctly what I always do. I‚Äôll pretend things are okay and on track, and I‚Äôm going to give up and let my train destroy itself. Maybe I‚Äôll drink a little along the way so I‚Äôm happy when it goes up in flames. \n\nI‚Äôm a worthless piece of shit, and no one knows exactly what I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôm dead, or the important part of me is, anyways. Sometimes, I have dreams about shooting myself. True story, I reallly have dreams about sticking s gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger. I‚Äôm not suicidal because I think killing gourself is pretty stupid and needless, but I wonder if something is trying to give me a sign. Whatever it is, go fuck yourself. One day, I‚Äôm going to die on my own. Up until then, I‚Äôll remain a whining little shit who thinks the world is difficult and life is so hard, because I just don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore. This is pointless and nothing you do matters. In 100 years, no one will remember you. Your just as useless as the rest of us . Goodnight. ",

There are periods of time when I can totally get excited about things (ADHD hyperfocus mainly), but it never lasts.

I‚Äôve got a couple close friends who care about me, a person who I‚Äôm intimate with casually (and who‚Äôs also a good friend, but I feel like I can‚Äôt ever fully open up/allow feelings due to avoidant attachment/some abandonment trauma..which makes me feel sad, b/c what‚Äôs the point in life really, when you can‚Äôt allow deep emotional connections with others?), for which I should be grateful, but at this point I thought that if I just stopped existing, it wouldn‚Äôt even matter..and this feeling kind of persists since then, which scares me (although no active suicidal thoughts).\n\nI‚Äôm more or less high-functioning as of being able to keep a job (but without the ‚Äústructure‚Äù/responsibility my work provides, I would probably be lost..it kind of grounds me), socializing now and then - but more than 1-2x a week feels so exhausting -but after work or on weekends, when I don‚Äôt meet up with people (which feels like just another distraction sometimes, brief dopamine hits, sometimes interpersonal connection, but mostly I still feel kind of emotionally detached). Most of the time this feels almost peaceful, but sometimes I really miss emotional intensity, and feel like I experience everything through a filter, or a thick fog, like being disconnected from reality and running on autopilot 80% of the time..\n\nAnyone can relate?

Regarding this I‚Äôve given bulimia the thought, I‚Äôve done it one or twice if I‚Äôm being honest, but as disgusted with my looks as I am I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not going down that path, I really want to start eating better and  working out like I used to but I just can‚Äôt, I just feel to lazy to do, but keep going with the negative thoughts. \n\n\nI‚Äôm feeling ugly, I take a bath every 2 days, I sometimes am so tired I sleep so much time, time that is never enough cause I still feel tired. \n\nI know I‚Äôm loved, and I know that the ‚Äúnobody likes/loves me feeling is just part of this feeling I can‚Äôt explain and is not true, I thank God for giving me some clarity in the midst of  whatever this is. \n\nMy relationship with god is not the same and that also makes me feel so bad.\n\nI was not the most proactive person 2 months ago but oh how I wish I could be like that again, the confident and full filled feeling that I can‚Äôt seem to find now. \n\nWhat I meant to ask with this big text above is, how do I get out of this, how do I get back to my old me, how do I start caring about my looks, continue my weightloss journey, feel better, energized.\n\nI thank all of you who read this, please if this has happened to you give me a tip or two I would truly appreciate it and am I depressed or is this something else? \n\nHave a nice day!",

My dorm mate keeps bringing up how often I‚Äôm in the room, but I have genuinely nothing else to do and no energy to do it. I have no friends after going to college and all of my attempts have led to them ghosting me which made me give up. I joined the swim club but it‚Äôs been mentally degrading since I learned that I‚Äôm bad the one thing I thought I was good at. My grades plummeted despite me studying for all my tests. I talk to my therapist and psychiatrist weekly but it‚Äôs always the same thing as the last 4 years. They have the same script for me to stop my suicidal thoughts and I go through saying that all the methods they suggest have never worked. I‚Äôm exhausted of this life, college is supposed to be the best years of my life, but I‚Äôm miserable. Everyone tells me it‚Äôs hard to find a group of friends in college, but everyone else I‚Äôve seen has no problems. I enjoyed going to the gym until I got body dysmorphia. I resorted to drinking alcohol alone in my room in order to feel anything. I‚Äôm out of social support, medical support, and most of all I‚Äôve given up on myself. I‚Äôve called the suicide hotline twice before attempts but I can‚Äôt see myself doing it again.",

        "text": "I'm having a really difficult time with this. I'm hoping I'm not alone, and that someone can help me get past this. I don't think we deserve to survive as a species anymore. And I'm having a hard time continuing with that.\n\nI feel like we are selling others out for cheaper whatever-the-hell, no one cares about anyone but themselves, and we're all destroying our planet for not just our species but everyones. I have nightmares of being with my loved ones, with my nieces, and watching the apocalyptic disaster come to our house, and I know all I can do is pray to a God I'm not sure I believe in while I watch it come for us, knowing I can't stop it. And the hard part is I know that is what we are working toward as a species.\n\nI love dogs, I think they have a lot of what we would call \"humanity\", perhaps more so than many humans.  My adult rescue dogs have the kindness that 90% of the human population lacks. I've seen empathy and compassion from dogs to a degree I really don't see from people. One of my dogs is pure pit, another has some in his mix, they were both given lives that were going to be crap ending in death, and they got lucky because a few humans cared. Half the population wants these dogs dead.\n\nHalf the population couldn't give a crap if a man or woman on the street was dying, or so it feels.\n\nHow do you all deal with this? I don't know how to discuss this, or if I can in social situations.\n\nI need help friends, I am having a rough time. It's hard to see the point right now when all signs point to us being terrible beings as a species. I don't want to have to watch this. I need to know how you all cope.\n\nPS- I really don't want anyone to fall deeper due to this. This is my personal struggle, and I know there is always hope, but I just need some help right now.",

I've been crying constantly for 2 weeks because I feel alone, and this 26th I turned 16 and I can't take it anymore, seriously, I can't take it anymore, everything in my fucking life is destroyed, I can't spend a fucking minute without my mind invading me again with the same fucking problems I have, I can't stop crying every day. I'm trying to meet a girl, we share similar tastes, like music, food, etc. but everything went to hell because of my fucking way of answering messages, dry shit, and what else? My FUCKING shitty nationality, seriously, I can't open my fucking mouth and say something without someone reminding me that I'm Venezuelan and that I'm an immigrant, I can't say that I work in something because they tell me \"don't Venezuelans only work in rappi?\". What's going on? My fucking nationality screwed up everything I tried to build with that girl, now I feel like I'm forcing her to talk to me and she answers me dryly. Nobody asks me how I really feel, or even wants to talk to me seriously. Calisthenics and trying to think about Jesus is the only thing that calms me down a bit, but then that self-hatred comes back, I feel like shit, I always fail Jesus even though I know he forgives, and a lot more.\n\n\n\nMy birthday 2 days ago was shit, my father scolded me for not turning in a history notebook, when I clearly told him that it was lost, what else? He got mad at me, I told my mother while we were eating sushi at home, she said: \"What do you have with your father?\", I told her: \"I never considered him my father, he's only financially and he only gave his sperm to have me.\" My father couldn't take it anymore and he smashed my keyboard against the floor and yelled at me, clearly he screwed me horribly... but it was even worse, we almost got into a fight, but I let it go, but then he started talking shit like he always does when he's angry, thinking he has all the fucking truth in life, I couldn't take it anymore and I yelled his fucking truths in front of my mother. But she pinned me against the wall hitting me, I think I passed out for a few seconds and he kept hitting me until he let me go, I kept crying... and the two of us were talking shit, I just went back to high school as if nothing had happened, but I couldn't take it anymore and I cried in the arms of a friend hugging him as hard as I could and I cried, thank God he gave me comfort.\n\n\n\nAnd today comes, I see no reason to live, I failed at everything I wanted, I think I am a very heavy family burden, I have failed God countless times, and I no longer see a reason, if you do not see an update it is possibly because I already did it, God bless you.",

I am having a really rough time right now, a lot has to do with school (but it's not the main reason). \nI have a pretty good life, and nothing I have to complain: but i know that something is wrong in me because I still feel helpless (even tough I have no reason to think that). \n\nSo the main problem here is that my doctor gave me antidepressants. My mom knows about it because she asked how my appointment went. I told her about the pills and she said ''but you're not depressed''. I'm not even sure I'm going to take them for the moment but she keeps sending me messages, and talking about it even though I keep telling her that I know what she thinks it and there's no point in keeping talking about it.\n\nShe keeps telling me that ''at your age (I'm in my early 20s') i was feeling the same and I didnt complain'' ''everyone is having a rough time its called life'' ''you dont have anything bad going on in your life, you're just privileged''. At this point I'm not even arguing with her because she won't listen to me, but she continues and continues on and on. She finished the conversation by ''Only people with a lot of time on their hands can be selfish like that'' \n\nI don't even understand what she means because I do not complain, she was the one initiating the conversation. I do not ask for pity or anything from her really, I didn't say anything. I do not blame her, I do not blame anything it's just the way it is, I do not understand why she is so mad at me for looking for help ? Again, I'm not even sure if I'm going to take the medication. \n\nAlso there's 2 diagnosed bipolar in my family (1 from each side), and I think my mother has an undiagnosed emotional unbalance (im sorry english isnt my first language, i dont know how to call this) so like yeah maybe its normal for her to feel like this but obviously that's not how ''''normal''''' people live their life. \n\n\nI will be grateful if someone could have me any advice on how to explain to her that I am not creating problems for attention or anything: i'm feeling like this since I was 12 years old and every year, it's getting worse and worse. If I am seeking help now, it's because it became a real problem in my day to day life and I really don't know how to navigate this without any professional help....? So why is she mad at me for trying to help myself? I really do not understand. \n\nThank you for your time and for anyone that can help me understand the situation:) !",

If you get off them you start to sober up which is definitely not pleasant. \n\nHowever it‚Äôs not like heroin which will act instantly, they sort of change how your brain functions in a slower way. Missing one typically doesn‚Äôt/ shouldn‚Äôt have this effect. I‚Äôm more enclined towards saying this is a placebo effect.\n\nThe good part is that they also happen to be a treatment, they‚Äôre happy pills for a bit until your brain learns to function on its own, which it will. When that happens your psychiatrist will slowly take you off them, as to not cold turkey you (which is really bad never do that). And then you will feel better without them than with them.\n\nSo don‚Äôt worry about all of that for now, follow your treatment, work on bettering yourself as best as you can, and don‚Äôt torture yourself over missing a day, your body can handle it.\n\nI hope it gets better"

I have not entertained the idea of being depressed until the past few days (I‚Äôm not sure why) \n\nSome context: I‚Äôm f(19). It‚Äôs been very hard for me for the past few years in a lot of areas of my life. I chalked it up to fucked dopamine levels and needing to quit social media etc etc \nI have struggled massively with insecurity about my body and the way I looked, to the point where I stopped going out and still dread going out. I would tell all my friends that I‚Äôm busy and I have something on that day in the hopes of being able to go out and be happy when I‚Äôm finally ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù enough. This insecurity has consumed every aspect of my life, affecting my education (went from A student to failing eveyrthing), can‚Äôt study because I feel so uncomfortable in my body and turned to food and social media as a source of comfort which made things worse as they made me feel shittier. this started when I was around 12 but really started affected me when I was around 14. \n\nI remember finding it very hard to listen in class and school felt like absolute hell for me. I would wake up extremely anxious because I had to go out for sch and could not hide in my room all day. in class, I would feel extremely anxious I suppose for long periods of time and would doodle and do anything but concentrate to distract myself. Which clearly affected my grades \n\nRight now, I find it very hard to do stuff. I don‚Äôt understand if it‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt realise it or if there is actually something I need to be concerned about. it‚Äôs very hard for me to shower fully as disgusting as it sounds. Seems so tedious. It‚Äôs hard for me to do chores and makes me irritable which often results in me snapping at my family members for no reason. I hate interacting with people and even my friends even tho I appreciate them a lot. my insecurities has made any form of dating extremely hard for me so I have never engaged in that. I feel very hopeless about life and my future. I have dreams and ambitions but I don‚Äôt know to move on from here. I‚Äôve been feeling this way for years and chalked it up to a lack of discipline. I‚Äôm sure there are more scenarios I can‚Äôt talk about but anything that requires energy or effort no matter how big or small seems extremely daunting. I can‚Äôt live like this. \n\nI‚Äôm not asking anyone if I have depression of some sort, I‚Äôm asking if people think it‚Äôs worth spending a few hundred bucks at a psychologist or if I am truly just a lazy fuck HAHA. (I‚Äôm asian so I‚Äôd have to spend money from a part time job myself and have no family support in this situation) ",

My mother is a narcissist and don't like talking to her she just makes things worse for me, my dad is a great hard working man he loves me and i love him too but i've disappointed him multiple times he has no expectations from me. I have only 4 friends that i talk to and i've never talked to a girl, i'm skinny very unattractive. i've broken soo many promises \"yeah, i'll do better next time\",\"i'll start studying\",\"i'll do this\",\"i'll do that\" i did shit. I like playing video games and i'm not even good at that i play games like Call Of Duty and i just barely perform average. When i was a kid i really loved drawing it was like the best thing in the world for me, i used to think i was the best artist but my mother was just like \"eh\" and then i slowly slowly stopped drawing and then some months ago there is a kid in my school bus he is in like 5th or 6th grade and i saw his drawings and i was just absolutely stunned how great they were, he is much younger than me and he still draws better than me i just couldn't believe it. And to make things better my life fucked me bipolar disorder, i have it for almost a year now ever since then i just don't feel anything, i just sit in front of my laptop and waste time and i very rarely go out now, i've also failed my recent exams and now my parents are about to find that out and when they do they'll take away my laptop. I'm a very pathetic person and i've accomplished nothing in my life and i have no qualities whatsoever. i just don't know what am i doing or what should i do.\n\nEdit: i might sound i'm over exaggerating but i needed this to get out of my brain.",

I've been dealing with depression since junior high, and I always figured that THE feeling (THAT feeling, the one with dread, the one where you've acquainted yourself with all the horrible thoughts and feelings that make you feel like less of a human) would go away. Now, approaching 19 years old, I think this is the saddest I have ever been. I find my desire to live nonexistent, and just the thought of getting out of bed to use the restroom or brush my teeth is beyond daunting. It's not that I have plans to take my own life anytime soon (although i welcome the idea of death with open arms), but I find it harder and harder each day to find the motivation, or at this point discipline, to be a functioning member of society. \n\nI am terrified that a portion of this is just me not wanting to get better and I'm finding comfort in this state. I am horrified of this actually. I have never felt so helpless and confused in my entire life.  Does anyone else understand what I mean? Is this sadness all I know, and am I too scared to step away from it? Am I making this up? Am I just lazy? I don't want this for me, but I'm scared that this is the only life I can see for myself.",

Most adults don't feel like adults. \n\nYou don't stop being a child and a teenager when you get older.

I feel like I can't talk directly to others about this, because I feel incredibly ashamed about it. Over and over a thought keeps coming up in my mind. What if I'm just telling myself that I have depression, when I might actually just be really fucking lazy? Thing is, sometimes I still do things like laugh at memes or something like nothing was wrong and sometimes even doing something that's supposed to be fun, like playing videogames, seems too exhausting to me. Hell, even taking care of my dog, which we adopted only because of me I should add, feels bothersome to me (Which makes me feel like I'm the lowest scum in existence). I feel like a liar and a worthless parasite all the time, like I'm just making up excuses so I don't have to go to school or do other things. I've cut myself a lot, just because I felt like I wasn't suffering enough. Weirdly, doing that brought me an actual moment of relief and I couldn't help but genuinely smile when I did it.\n\nI honestly do not believe that I have a future and it feels like suicide is my only way out. I know that I have to end my life sooner or later if I want to stop being a damn burden to everyone.\n\nI have no idea if, by writing this post, I'm just trying to convince myself that I'm depressed once again. \n\nTo summarize, here's why I'm probably just lazy:\n\n- I don't feel sad all the time. Sometimes I feel fine and forget these thoughts for some time.\n\n- I still have the energy to watch videos on YouTube or look at memes, but lack the energy to do actual useful things.\n\n- Wouldn't be the first time that I lied to not have to make an effort.",

Everything I think about myself is overwhelmingly negative, and I know that‚Äôs something many people with depression can relate to. \n\nSocial expectations and stigma play a large role in why we think this about ourselves. Society also often associates productivity with self-worth. Symptoms of depression include excessive self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy. We give ourselves shit for not accomplishing various things, when our lack of motivation and energy is a direct result of our depression. \n\nI think you might believe you‚Äôre \"just lazy\" because you likely have a highly negative view of yourself, which is, again, a symptom of depression. It is just another negative thought amidst many of others. I think this specific thought sticks out for us because we feel that other people view us as lazy, and think that our depression is just an excuse not to get things done... like it isn't real. We start believing that ourselves. We often end up with other people's critical voices becoming our own.\n\nSome people believe that depression is merely an excuse or a crutch to avoid facing everyday challenges, but this perspective stems from ignorance. There is a significant amount of stigma surrounding mental health as a whole.\n\nPeople often use the word \"depressed\" casually to describe simply having a bad day, which, in my opinion, diminishes the true seriousness of depression in the eyes of the general public. The term is being misused.\n\nI‚Äôm starting to realize that almost everyone who suffers with depression wonders if they‚Äôre \"just lazy.\" This illness is so misunderstood, especially by those who haven‚Äôt experienced it firsthand.\n\nThis is one of my favorite quotes: \"It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.\"\n\nIt makes me wonder whether my mental health struggles are rooted in my brain chemistry or if they are a direct result of trying to conform to societal norms that are fundamentally flawed.\n\nI hope you get to laugh today."

Today is Thanksgiving my favorite holiday but all I want to do is die. I won't kill myself nor am I in danger of such to be clear. I am hoping for a death of natural causes. It used to be i was depmessed because of my own mind. When I was 6 years old I realized I had on average 560,640 hours approximately to live. That gets me to 70. In that time I knew I would suffer heart, headache, and disappointment. My only thought was why put myself through that.  What is the point if I am just gonna die and it is meaningless anyway. So from 6 to 12 I was suicidal. I won't say how many times I tried just that I did alot. At 9 I was discouraged. Nothing worked and I didn't have the courage to try anything more direct. Most of my attempts were posion or accelerated natural causes. However like I said nothing worked. So I decided if I couldn't die I could find a reason to live. So I thought about it and realized that it was family. My fear for my own demise stemmed from worry how my family would treat me if I failed. I could handle dying. I couldn't handle the pity, the knowing looks, or the eggshells. So I thought why not build my own. That is a reason. Look at Hitler I thought. Look at Mother Teresa I thought. They were remembered. My life doesn't have to be the wind. It can be a pebble in a pond. No splash but the pond is never the same anyway. And it worked for a time. I had a goal and I pushed. What I didn't expect was about a week ago. I didn't expect to hear what I did. I literally sacrificed everything for my parents and siblings. My health and my money. However I heard last week that my parents consider me a disappointment. I am struggling hard with money. Have been for a while. Everytime I reached put for support from said parents i was denied. Some siblings would help but they would ridicule me. Well last week I heard them say I am a disappointment. That I should have had my life together already and I am just a leech. It broke me guys. I just don't know if I can muster the will to go on. I am not gonna kill myself but I also have stopped living. I no longer eat more than once a day. I don't move unless I have to. I haven't said this to my girl but honestly I don't think she would want to know. I haven't thought about my own death this much since I was 6. So I guess thoughts? What would you guys do?",

It took 5 people to get me to leave him there. First 2 months after he died were a relief, as horrible as that sounds. But nothing hit me yet. Not mentally. I was just a husk, relieved to have so much pressure suddenly lifted from my shoulders. \n\nI thought I had a good enough friend good and hobby that I would be ok after he died. No one prepared me for the mass exodus that comes with death. All your friends fail to appreciate the experience, don't have the patients or empathy, or frankly don't want the drama and stress. I don't blame them, but it still hurts so much. \n\nI am now losing my hobby and the rest of the life I tried to build over the last few years. I put myself into debt and there is a constant major financial issue that comes up. \n\nI have no meaningful family besides my mother. Before my dad died, I swore up and down I was cutting her out because of her behavior and treatment. Now she's all I have left. Extended family on my dad's side is thousands of miles away. My mom's family was always portrayed as evil and they are all in a legal battle with each other. \n\nI am burdened with animals I love. I fear for them if something happens to me. It would take months before anyone noticed. \n\nI hate what my life has become. I was happy and thriving a few years ago. I was confident I could do things and had goals. Now. Now I see nothing but a futile future. I have nothing to offer anymore. I am a hollow shell and lack the support to ever be more than a mental burden. \n\nI don't know why I am here each day. Why does numbness stop action. A quiet moment comes and my thoughts go wild and I'm left with a reminder of how badly things changed. I want to be done. ",

I get very surprised if anyone actually directly talks or acknowledges me. I don‚Äôt really know why. sometimes I think it‚Äôs because the way I look or I‚Äôm just uninteresting I can‚Äôt help but feel depressed because of this.\nEveryone I know has at least couple of good things happening to them but nothing good has happened to me in the past 2 years of my life and I‚Äôm sick of waiting. The problem is the only way I can be motivated to do anything with my life is if something good is happening to me in my social life but nothing is. So I often just rot in bed hoping something will happen even tho I know it won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve just been feeling very empty. And overall jealous of others.\nBy feeling this way for a long time it has made me think about how unfair life really is for a lot of people. Some people have the best life‚Äôs while some are born into pain and a life of suffering. No I am not comparing my life to this I know I am very privileged.but thinking about this has just made me even more depressed. \n\nI just wanted to know if anyone feels the same way.\n\nJust wanted to add I know my life isn‚Äôt terrible and people are far worse of,just needed to get this of my chest .",

Therapists have said that they are unable to continue progressive work with him. We don't know what to do next and are scared of doing the wrong things.\n\nI am the older brother (26) writing about my younger brother (19). Before I set up the story and get into the details, I want to prioritize some observations about him to keep in mind when reading the post. I am not a doctor nor is my mom.\n\nMy younger¬† brother was always zoning out in times growing up. He did have friends as a child but struggled to participate in things that require human interaction and people skills. He was signed up for so many activities and did not object to any. Today we find him spending his time staring at walls. To give you an idea, he can stay in bed the entire day and do nothing. I mean nothing. He can be on a 14 hour flight and stare in his seat and do nothing, not even use the bathroom. Staring in front of him with no tv, no game, no book. We try to offer him a movie to watch or something to do but he chooses not to. No interest in movies, music, exercise, nothing. He can go hours even days without eating unless my mother makes him food and asks him to eat. He has virtually no interest and no hobbies and hasn't had a friend for 5 years. He pulls his phone out in social situations just to scroll left and right on his homepage. He doesn't actually do anything on it. We think it's to reduce some form of anxiety when in public or with people in general. He is silent in conversation and doesn't talk unless being talked to, even then he replies with. Maybe, sometimes, yes, no, kinda and essentially one word answers. He is slow at processing and moving from one activity to the other. To get him out of the house can take hours, to get him out of the car can also be hours. He lives in an extreme denial of his life that he is okay and can do well in all situations, while on the other hand he seems that he is extremely hard on himself. It almost seems like he has to put on a strong front with a lot of pride in order to cope with the lack of ability to obtain a job, do well in school, and socialize. He blacks out at times of high anxiety and stress. He doesn't remember hitting me or calling my mom names. (more of this portion later)\n\nMy little brother lives with my mom and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is extremely nice and sweet and will never get in between them or try and raise my younger brother. My mother loves him extremely and can suffocate him at times with being at his every need. I can't blame her given that if she doesn't cook every meal then he simply won't eat. My little brother does not do what he is told, it almost seems that he is not capable at simple tasks. Like his mind is his own prison that restricts him from doing anything that he wants to do. He always says he will do something and ends up not. Examples are when he is asked to go outside for 30 min he says he will later and on his own time but finds himself in his bed instead. My mother does everything to get him out of bed, she works minimal hours so she can be present and revolves her life around him. She can do this due to having money saved up. He has had some small wins like getting a drivers license, starting school at a community college and spending time with a group of friends for an hour a week at an organized event. He does great at his math classes but fails his english classes. He lies about going to the guidance counselor and talking about classes next term as he is lost and doesn't know how to navigate college yet wont ask for help. It took me an entire day of pulling teeth to get him to show me his English grade that he said he was receiving a good grade and ended up not submitting the past 15 assignments and having a 47%. Interesting thing is he submitted the first 15 or so assignments and was receiving good grades, then he stopped all of a sudden. It seems that he lacks motivation in life for practically anything. It seems that he is paralyzed by his anxiety to do anything. Yet when I ask him questions about situations that he froze in, he wants to be left alone and laughs at it and lies that it was for a made up reason. I asked him if he felt nervous, or if his heart rate went up, or why he changed his mind. He seems to be disconnected from his emotions completely.\n\nMy part. I have an opposite approach than my mother. My father has not been much a part of his life from year 14 to present day. My father set boundaries and limitations while my mother struggled to. When I talk to my mom I try to explain to her that she must set boundaries, otherwise he will never achieve any independence or happiness. He will continue to stay put in his comfortable situation, rather than take chances and risks to expand his life. I tell him that he must show his mother his grades at school, that he needs to go outside at times. I am scared this feeds into his low self esteem and ends up hurting him more, but I don't know what to do otherwise. I want to recognize he has something but we don't know what it is. We have had professionals say he is not depressed or anxious while others said he is both. We have had professionals say he has a form of autism, while others say he does not. I try to get my mother to force a healthy routine in his life of what he is capable of, with consequences. Thing is we can't give him any since he has nothing in his life he values that we could take from him. He is 19 but I can't get my mother to give him the consequence of sleeping outside. She doesn't have it in her. I do but I know that if I force this when I am around and my mother doesn't then it won't solve anything. Rather it would do more harm than good. I dont stay with my mothers long enough to instill positive behavior and routine.\n\nWhen I push him. When I push him too hard he can blow up. This has only happened a few times. Ex: I came to visit during the summer and we drove two hours to a specific hike on 100 degree day. He wanted to stay in the car and I was not having it. He ended up blowing up and hitting me while he was screaming ‚Äòjust hit me already‚Äô yet I have never hit him in my adult life. As kids we played rough at times but even then I would take his hits and rarely hit him back or retaliate. During these times of stress his entire body goes berserk. He slams doors, sprints away, breathes heavily, screams at the top of his lungs and his face goes to anger. He blacks out and doesn't remember any of these events.¬†\n\nLies and argumentative. Pretty self explanatory. Even when caught red handed he denies it with all his ability. It almost seems like he views as the world against him. He plays on my moms emotions to get what he wants. He makes her feel bad for him so he can be left alone and not do the things he say he will do that would be good for him.\n\nI had a talk with him about exposure therapy. Since he couldnt get the courage to walk up and ask for a job, I ask him to go buy a coffee for me so he talks with the person at the counter. He laughs and says that he can do it and that its easy. Yet I try to reason with him saying that when we went to costco so he could ask for a job he didnt pull through with it. Thats why we need to start small. He seemed to tense up and ask me questions like what exactly should I say. I tell him to order a small black coffee, as a way to keep it simple. He asks me if the lady will ask him any more questions afterwords. I told him she might ask if he wants sugar and to say no to that question. We needed to go over this a few times in order to prep him. He ended up completing this and I praised him for it. Yet when i praised him for it he shrugged it off like it was nothing and it was a joke. That he easily could have done it. I give him genuin compliments at times and he turns it around like im making fun of him, when I give him pointers to be successful he takes it as criticism instead.\n\nDoesnt open up. Not to my mom, me or any therapist he has ever talked to. Which is why therapists stop working with him since they cant make progress.\n\nA bit more about him and his life. My family moved around a lot. Including myself but him most since he was 7 years younger than me. Always new environment, new friends, new cultures. When he was younger he was laughing and joking and playful. He played piano and was really good at it. He played sports growing up including water polo and soccer. He spent time with friends and me and him have always had a close relationship. When I left the house at 18 and he was 11 things seemed fine. I went through drug addiction and got clean at 22. My sister had her tantrums growing up and left at 17. My father and mother split when i was 22 and he was 15. I didnt notice any of the bad blood between them, but it started to escalate a year or so after I left the house around the time I was most deep into my addiction. During this time I believe my little brother was neglected. I spent years raising him as a teenager since my father spent his time traveling for work. He was essentially left alone all of a sudden, with parents who fought regularly and no one to turn to. Given his character we also think he may have been bullied at school. We never found out through him. Around this time is when he closed up.¬†\n\nMedication: recently he started taking an ssri. Otherwise nothing.",

Since I was 14 years I wanted to kill myself. A lot of it has to do with my upbringing and the fact that I was practically brought up in a religious cult. I think that is why I went on and admitted everything in the hope of washing my sins clean. I sabotage myself a lot because of this belief. \n\nAlso, I usually worry a lot about my future and have anxiety, so my steps are very thought out. When I'm depressed, I just do things and don't worry about the consequences. So when I sleep and eat a bit after such a hard time and somehow look forward to the next day, I think about all the mistakes I've made in my depressed state and go back to wanting to kill myself. \n\nHow do I get out of this?

        "text": "Hello, I (21M) have been struggling a lot with depression my whole life. Lately, I can tell I‚Äôm improving, but it‚Äôs not without struggle. It feels like that‚Äôs all I do. It‚Äôs incredibly difficult for me to connect with other people because of my trust issues, and depression telling me that they don‚Äôt want to interact with me, anyway. So many of my relationships in life (romantic but also family & platonic) have been disasters. I feel like I can‚Äôt trust anyone with my feelings and the weight is becoming unbearable. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm on reddit, I will take any form of consolation or advice I can get, so long as I don‚Äôt have to put myself in a compromising position. Strangers are easier to talk to, because they don‚Äôt take on my burden, and they won‚Äôt exploit my feelings against me. I used to be someone who loved so much, and gave so much, because I thought it would save me from myself and my situation. It ended horribly for me. It has only ever ended horribly for me. At least now, I am learning self love. It‚Äôs hard as hell but I‚Äôve come a long way. I think, so long as I have that anchor (as brand new and vulnerable as it may be), I can start to work towards having meaningful connections with others. I just don‚Äôt know how people do it. Even friendship or acquaintance scares me sometimes. I see everyone as a potential threat that could bring me back to ground 0, terrified of myself and the violence I would inflict on myself when alone. Every friendship feels like a huge risk. But I can‚Äôt stay bottled up like this, it hurts and explodes in the worst ways. I hurt other people and myself in the process. I keep trying to fix it but I‚Äôm grasping at straws. I just can‚Äôt go back to where I was at, I‚Äôm so scared of myself back then, when I would sit in my empty tub and fantasize about it being the last thing I‚Äôd see, or slice myself up like sashimi every night, out of boredom, or self hatred, or the day‚Äôs events, it didn‚Äôt even matter, I‚Äôd just do it. I‚Äôm so so so scared but I‚Äôm tied up in chains. The only thing I know how to do is smile and evade, I convince myself they don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs really happening with me, anyway, and I take out all that feeling on some minuscule thing they did, to prove to myself that I was right all along. But I wasn‚Äôt. Or I can‚Äôt tell anymore. I cut it off before I can even find out and spend a week hating myself because of it. I think, no one deserves to be treated the way I treat them, they‚Äôre better off without me. So I should really leave them be. But I‚Äôm so greedy, and maybe I know that‚Äôs not true, right? I don‚Äôt know. I really need help. That‚Äôs the only thing I know. \nI hope I didn‚Äôt break any community rules. Thank you for reading. ",

I'm lonely, don't have any friends and have never hung out with anybody in my life I'm basically a homebody, I  barely step outside my house unless it's to help my parents buy groceries and church. I don't really like it when anyone comes to my house cause my house is old and looks horrendous and I'm quite insecure about my house, but I'm trying my best to be grateful for the things that I have because of my parents but the thing is that I can't seem to be grateful. I'm just and angry teenager, I really don't know if it's the hormones but somewhere I do feel my parents also took a part in my depression cause my mom is clinically diagnosed with depression.\n\n I have an absent parent(my mom, for context she's a nurse), she used to bust her ass working day and night doing extra shift so that she could feed her children and my dad also used to work but it was a 9 to 5 so he used to have time after work to spend with us when I was young. So from the time that I could remember I never saw my mother and her really felt that nurtured by my mom(even though she tries so hard to take an extra day off so that she could spend with me) I felt quite close to my dad cause he used to take us to malls, parks etc. I'm just really numb and mentally  exhausted even though I dont have a job and just go to school and come back and do my homework. These days I can't even focus on my studies cause of how low I've been feeling.\n\n Sometimes I question myself saying that it winter and it's fine, but how long will I keep lying to myself? Every year has just been the same for me even though I try to make some changes but I feel that once I got to college I might stop feeling depressed (this is oy a maybe). Why can't I feel normal like a normal teenage for once. I dont have a boyfriend and haven't associated and being with a boy since day 1 so I was never desired or loved by boys at school. Everyone just saw me as the funny girl. Sometimes I think that being funny is my coping mechanism, I love making fun of others and trolling them but thats just my personality and I can't change that. I think the one good thing about me is my humour sense and how I make others laugh. Metal health is a very taboo topic to discuss in my family (at this point mental health is tabooer than sex) if I tell my parent that I'm depressed they'll be like it fine just go out for a walk or I'll cook you your fav food. So it's better not to talk about these kind of things and I have been hiding my emotions these days and seeing a therapist is not going to work out unless I have money which I don't have and therapy is really expensive, so that's not going to happen until and unless I get out of my house. \n\nI know this is quite long but take your own time and read it, if you want to read it you can read it. Just let me know :D\n",

That said high school graduation helps with getting jobs and if you are ever crazy like me and decide to become a scientist, you need it to go to college.

        "text": "I literally in the last few months have literally lost absolutely every... my schooling, my brother, my mother, my mother in law. An possibly more I just can't forecast anymore what is to come next. I just want to blame it on something spiritual because idk my life is literally unbelievable. I could tell you guys my life & every step of the way you'd question me because all the things that happen to me are the dumbfounding. The even of my life sound like a movie, a book the craziest reality show ever. It's that unbelievable I don't tell many people because I've heard. You've got to making things up.. I wish I was.. I wish I way lying ..I couldn't make these things up if I tried. For some reason life keeps handing my card I don't know how to deal with I'm doing my best. I mean that with my chest. Since my brother past though my life has completely spun out of control.  I have narcissist mother & no friends.  So when you have a mother like that to start well.. anyone who's delt with one my mother would put them all to shame she's unbelievable.. but again I can't even feel like I can truly advocate for myself because all the things they do to me sound like I'm telling an excuse.  A lie, so I stay quiet and suffer in silence. Isolated from any friends an intimate relationships. I just feel alone & lost like there's absolutely no way out and things keep getting worse. I didn't think things could get any worse but they do. I've lost every single thing I love all I have is my dog left & he needs me more then I need him. I'm falling apart I don't know how to make all the continuous hurt & trauma if I try to explain it you simply cannot understand it fully unless you see it for your actual self actively. No one believes me unless I show them I can't tell people because they think I'm paranoid & crazy. Until they actively see it first hand & experience some if it for they're own eyes I sound delusional. How do you get help when it's like that... how can anything get better I'm so lost..",

        "text": "I‚Äôve been unemployed for the last 4 months and am sitting at my wits end with looking anymore and becoming homeless and losing my marriage. \nIve put in 300+ apps and resumes in the last 4 months with 56 interviews. After all 56 interviews, no job. I stayed within the parameters of my career experience, went outside my experience, even went straight to trying to get a fast food job or grocery job. All were a bust. I would hear, you qualifications a good, but no degree. Fast food wants a more ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù crew. Grocery stores, over qualified‚Ä¶. IM OVER IT!!!!!!!\nI‚Äôve pushed myself hard in every job I work to move up just to find out I‚Äôve wasted my time to be pushed to do supervisor work without supervisor pay. I‚Äôve given my 150% all the time, work well with teams, and even given in on working overtime and pushing my personal life to the side multiple times. And here I am, unemployed and can‚Äôt even get an entry level job. I‚Äôve taken classes for training in different areas of business and IT. But nobody cares unless u have a college degree, even if the degree doesn‚Äôt match the job. At this point in my life, giving up and disappearing sounds like a really good option. I get around 3-4 hours of sleep everyday, because I worry about how I‚Äôm going to keep the lights on and a roof over my head. I‚Äôve payed my child support diligently up until now. My youngest turns 18 on New Year‚Äôs Eve and my cs was to be over. Now I‚Äôm 4 months behind and already been threatened jail. Like that makes any matters better. Jail means I‚Äôll just be further behind with interest attached. \nMy wife and I had separated about a month ago and it was all about how her feelings on how things are going, that she needed to leave because of ‚Äúher‚Äù sanity.  Not once did she take into consideration about how I‚Äôm feeling. And all I hear from her family, is that she needs to go find better. Maybe she‚Äôs better off without me, I don‚Äôt know. Both my parents are gone, my brother OD the day before dad passed, mom passed a few years before dad passed. And I was the child of theirs to be responsible for all of it. My only living sibling lives on the west coast while I‚Äôm here in Ohio. Family in Florida that I can‚Äôt afford to go see. My oldest son is in Alaska with the military, so I won‚Äôt get to see him. My youngest live with his mom and step dad, so pretty much the last 11 years I never got my children for the holidays, barely a phone call on my birthday, but would always go out of my way, like any parent should do, to wish them happy birthday. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. This brick wall I‚Äôve hit is 20ft thick and I have spoon. I just don‚Äôt see a way of getting thru it anymore. \nWhat‚Äôs sad is, I used to be a very optimistic, outgoing person. I would never let myself get deterred from things that bother most people daily. But now, I put a fake smile on, hold back tears, and hope that no one see me hiding my sorrow and feeling used and abused. \nIve become an extremely jealous and envious man for things that I‚Äôve dreamed about, while watching everyone else get the opportunities that I never got. When I was younger, I wanted a military life(family thing) but got turned down 8 times, all was minor medical stuff. Always wanted to work towards being an astronaut, I‚Äôm too tall.\nI‚Äôm just tired of being pushed to the back burner all the time. I grew up that way(middle child) both my siblings had help from my parents to get into college, I didn‚Äôt get the same help. I had some opportunities in high school that could have changed my career life, but parents refused me to have these opportunities because HS diploma was more important. Everything in my life has been about everyone else while I stay invisible to everyone. even when it comes to my wife and her family. I‚Äôm invisible to them unless they need me to do something for them. And then while helping them, being treated poorly and talked down to, I really don‚Äôt want to help anymore. With the wife, while we have been married, her family has given her money to go buy a vehicle, while mine was broke down. Then give her money to go to vet tech school, and other odds and ends that she wants. But the to sit there while the hand her a check, just to be told that money is hers to use, that I don‚Äôt have a say so. So I sit back and watch how differently I‚Äôm treated and just keep my mouth shut. And then forced to go to her family get togethers for holidays feels like a waste of time to me. Last few Christmas‚Äôs I had to sit and watch everyone open up gifts of things the actually asked for, then being told we forgot to get you something. ‚ÄúWe will make sure we get something for you later‚Äù and still get nothing. It‚Äôs not about the gift that bothers me most, it‚Äôs about wanting to feel like I belong. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm part of her family and all I want now is to spend time with my family. I suggested it last year to visit my family in Florida, when finances were available, and was shot down immediately because they want my wife there for her family‚Äôs Christmas. I‚Äôm happy to see everyone enjoy their time with each other, but when it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm being treated much differently than everyone else, my wife never acknowledges it. Even when I bring it up to her. I couldn‚Äôt tell u the last time I actually felt happy to feel like I belong somewhere. \nI guess happiness is only for those that matter in life and I just got dealt the hand where I always lose every hand. \nEvery time I bring up my issues and emotions, the reply I get, ‚Äúsuck it up, your man and figure it out!‚Äù Well I‚Äôm tired!!!! I almost feel I need to just pack up some of my stuff and move away. Move away from everyone!!! \nI don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Anytime I think happiness is on its way, I get pushed two steps back. \nI‚Äôm sure to the few that reads this might think I‚Äôm just complaining about stuff that doesn‚Äôt warrant a complaint, but you‚Äôre not in my shoes, which I need shoes too lol, life is different for everyone and this is the life I‚Äôm living right now.
