I heard about it on a podcast. You know how all our lives experts say you need x number of cups of green leafy vegetables, x amount of fiber, x amount of certain types of proteins; it occurred to me that I had always looked to medicine or something external. The one thing that I had not done focused on eating in a way that I'm getting enough of what I need rather than just counting calories and carbs to get fit .\n\nI started to feel different in just a week after following his advice. He makes the claim that much of our depression and anxiety symptoms, while it's definitely influenced by our genetics, the symptoms could be caused by simple malnutrition. \n\nHis best advice for me was to eat like an explorer. Try and get the widest variety of nutrition tha you can in the meals and only supplement what you couldn't possibly get through those times. \n\nDon't get me wrong, its easier said than done. My experience was that the hardest week was the first and then it got a lot easier because my racing thoughts stopped and my anxiety response went way down.  It felt like it gave my brain the extra horsepower it needed to be able to throw through problems without the same amount of heightened negative emotions.  \n\nI actually lost a ton of weight after staying on this and I wasn't even counting calories. You give your body just what it needs your appetite is a lot easier to control and your mind feels better.\n\nThe human brain at just under 2 lbs uses about a quarter of your caloric load in a day. Thoughts use energy. That nutrition helps your mind be more resilient. \n\nI wish you the best of luck. Remember it's only hard in the beginning and then it starts to give you back so much more that it gets easier."

Once you've performed this test, add any brand of magnesium complex and take both daily.\n\nAlso aggressively support potassium.  Lots of fresh food has potassium - meat and salad does.  But use the half and half salt, and consider adding straight potassium chloride to water - or there are other ways.  Gluconate I think maybe.  Don't avoid sodium; avoid crappy food though - if it has a lot of sodium, check if there is a hidden reason it is also crappy.\n\nYou should shotgun-spray random B vitamins at the problem.  The wrong one could make it worse, but you're in the shit anyway.

Now, every day is a workout again.  You'll find new weak points, and the game will shift.  With bad luck or bad diet, joints and other connective tissue will go bad even if you play the game well.\n\nLearn how to take a fall and do a little 'animal flow' type stuff to see how that feels; check yourself out in the mirror practicing various mobility goals like tying shoes, third-world squat, and leaping like an antelope while flailing your arms but suddenly landing in a graceful interpretive dance representing the first splash of water on a small - cherished, but no longer useful - campfire.\n\n(this help is brought to you by cannabis)\n\nBut it really is about the squat - or things related to it; kettlebell stuff, some centered and some not.  Weighted carries.  Deadhangs, dips... It's pretty endless.  Honestly, dance is an invaluable window.  Probably kung fu, too; certainly basics like horse stance.

The way you describe it (repeating the calming words) could be the compulsion since you mention it helps you calm or de-escalate. I think it depends of your specific case, but for example for me (ruminating thoughts, always the same/same subject, getting worse and worse and that feel inescapable) it was sort of an \"obsessive disorder\" although without the compulsion part (this is how my doctor described it, and it was accurate lol)\n\nIf it can reassure you, know that OCD and assimilated disorders/forms of anxiety like the one you describe can be treated very well. I deal with the occasional anxiety still, but the obsessive and ruminating thoughts do not cause me anguish anymore, even though when I was in the thick of it I was absolutely certain I would never be able to spend a day without them. Now, if they come back, they disappear after a couple minutes and don't cause me to spiral, CBT has been incredibly helpful. The only \"advice\" I could give is to remember that thoughts aren't you and most of all, are temporary and not real. I really advise talking to a therapist if you can, it can be super helpful to learn how to manage them."

        "text": "I always believed that anxiety was solely that feeling you get in your gut, when you're nervous in front of your crush or before you were going to do a presentation or public speak. I had never realized how bad it can actually get. I was actually one of the people that said, oh, it's just anxiety. It's just in your head until I started having panic attacks myself very recently.\n\nDear God, it is one of the most horrifying things I have went through in my entire life. From the feeling like you're dying to overthinking every last thing, even something as small as a small pain in your foot that came from you slightly bumping it as you stumble around in an anxious stupor, dizzy, can't eat, new pains popping up from anxiety ALONE making it 10x worse (I didn't even know I could just hurt in that spot...?)\n\nThe brain fog and mental horribleness/complete change in mentality that just *exists* while you are in a rut of anxiety and stress is just the cherry on top as well. I've seen so many people just like me that have went to the ER for symptoms, being told that they are perfectly fine and healthy and just have to deal with the demon that has sprouted inside of their own minds. \n\nEveryone here is so strong. Those that suffer are so strong and brave, and I didn't realize it before it happened to me. I just learned that my mom was diagnosed with a panic disorder at age 27, and it seems like I might be developing that as well at 24. \n\nI will never, ever talk down with \"it's just anxiety\" ever again.",

                "body": "I relate to exactly this. When I first started experiencing anxiety I made a post ‚ÄúOh THIS is anxiety?‚Äù to a very similar tune to your post. \n\nI‚Äôve recently been learning from my therapist about the difference between state and trait anxiety. Basically it‚Äôs like triggers vs baseline anxiety. State anxiety is what we feel when a specific triggering thing comes along - a flight, an appointment, a presentation. Trait anxiety is the baseline levels of anxiety we feel at any given moment. And we all have some level of trait anxiety I think. It‚Äôs healthy to have a part of our brain that helps us plan ahead, account for potential challenges, avoid problems. I call that part of myself the the navigator. He likes to plan adventures and avoid dangers. But it‚Äôs like for some of us, an event will come along where it‚Äôs like that Navigator gets gamma radiation, and goes into hulk mode. Now instead of just helping us avoid real dangers on the map, it‚Äôs perceiving everything as a potential danger. ‚ÄúWhat if there‚Äôs rocks in the ocean that aren‚Äôt on the map?? What if there‚Äôs a kraken??‚Äù. It gets supercharged with strength, running around and pinning down all the other crew members. Actually Inside Out 2 does an amazing job of portraying this IMO.\n\nBut at a practical, real level, I get exactly what you mean. It‚Äôs like your brain just completely changes. All the lightness and hope in your heart feels gone. The pep is gone from your step. The hulk-mode navigator is gripping into your stomach and heart. You feel nauseated and like your heart is racing. Your brain is constantly drawn to worst case instead of best case scenarios. You have intrusive thoughts. It could be the best, chillest, most enjoyable day on paper and instead of just being happy about it, your brain has like a gravitational pull toward ‚Äòbut what if‚Ä¶ [insert horrible thing]‚Äù. Like why?? The normal brain ‚Äî my brain just a few months ago!! - wouldn‚Äôt do that. It wouldn‚Äôt dwell on all the scary potentials and what ifs. It would simply enjoy the pleasant reality. I wouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much of my mental energy reminding my anxious part ‚Äúthat fear isn‚Äôt current or present, so we don‚Äôt need to worry about it.‚Äù\n\nBasically, it‚Äôs like some event happens, and our baseline of anxiety gets turned up to 11, so then when any normal trigger comes along it feels that much more extreme.\n\nI feel like people who have never experienced this heightened anxiety have a hard time understanding. It‚Äôs hard to understand how consuming it is. How physical it is. How hard it makes it to be present. How much mental work it takes every day just to try and keep that baseline of anxiety at what feels like a manageable level. \n\nI will say a few things I‚Äôve learned just in these four months I‚Äôve been dealing with it ‚Äî \n\n1) I spent the first few months trying really hard to manage the anxiety. I spent most of every day focused on it, trying to fix it. Understandable - it‚Äôs so intense. But the moments/days when I‚Äôve felt like my trait anxiety was the lowest were when I just moved past it. I woke up and took a more proactive approach to the day. I got busy with work, spending time with friends, playing a game, doing a hobby. By not letting the anxiety dominate the conversation, and adopting more of a ‚Äòbring it on‚Äô mindset, the trait anxiety felt much less extreme.\n\n2) It does seem to be getting better. My limited understanding is that the trait anxiety feels more intense because something (a traumatic experience, a panic attack, bad experience with alcohol or drugs, whatever it may be) disregulated your nervous system. HPA axis is out of balance, cortisol levels out of wack, cortisol receptors hyper sensitized. It‚Äôs like breaking a bone - it breaks in a moment, but can take months of care to heal correctly. For me, now four months into this journey, it‚Äôs still a journey. Some days are still pretty bad, some not as bad. Most days anxiety is still a constant presence in my mind. But some days I started noticing some hours that felt almost normal again. Then more hours of more days. A few weeks ago I had a few days where I hardly noticed any anxiety and I almost felt like my old self. Then it came back a bit. It‚Äôs non-linear, but with continued care and intentionality I can see how week over week, month over month, it seems like that trait anxiety is slowly returning back to more normal levels. \n\nIn the meantime, on one hand I‚Äôm daily reminded that I‚Äôm stronger than I think. What feels like it will overwhelm or consume me, actually doesn‚Äôt. I endure. And I still find moments of laughter and joy that make it all worth it. But one the other hand - God I hope to start feeling better soon. It‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm so tired of waking up every day, and the first question in my mind being an assessment of how intense the anxiety feels. I‚Äôm tired of spending my whole day trying to decide what will best help calm my anxiety in this moment - should I watch a show? Visit with friends? Drink some tea? I‚Äôm tired of every day trying to decide whether I should tell my spouse how my anxiety feels that day and just venting, or is she tired of hearing about it and I should just keep it to myself? Will talking about it just make me focus on it more - making it worse, or will talking about it help me process the anxious thoughts in a healthy way? Is writing this comment helping or hurting? I‚Äôm just tired of all of it. I want to feel normal again. I have hope that I will with time. But like‚Ä¶ God please let that be sooner than later."

Of course the threat *identification* system in anxious people is out of whack - your amygdala is a like a lookout but it has shit eyesight. It sends low-resolution first impressions to the brain and can jump to conclusions so to speak. Better safe than sorry when in nature.

Than I blacked out, before realizing that the point was of course inside one of the shops. This was such a strange thing to experience. So now I'm convinced I'm developing early onset Alzheimer's or have a brain tumor. Could the stress and cortisol do this to my mind?",

I woke up feeling so detached from everything this morning and didn't want to get out of bed. I began crying hysterically like I did the night before so the decision was made to bring me to the behavioral health emergency department. Speaking to the MD, he told me I definitely have textbook GAD and also panic disorder. He said that I needed to give Effexor (75 mg which I was previously given 2 weeks ago) a few more weeks to fully kick in and Ativan to help alleviate bad anxiety symptoms when they arise. On top of the Ativan, he prescribed me propranolol, a beta block. to assist in alleviating symptoms. He didn't want to commit me because I wasn't a threat to myself or others Thank full for his honesty. \n\nWanted to get y'all's insight on how to cope with the anxiety in the meantime or any tips to help.\n\nStay blessed",

Maybe you have a flight or a presentation or got scary news from a doctor. Trait anxiety, on the other hand, is like the baseline that you‚Äôre starting from. It‚Äôs the anxiety you having at any given moment of any given day without any particular reason or cause. \n\nThis was a helpful distinction for me, because I can see how I‚Äôve always had things that caused state anxiety. Flights or big tests might make me feel anxious and nauseated. And there always will be things that trigger state anxiety for me. ImBut ever since having a bad panic attack one night a few months ago, it‚Äôs my trait anxiety that has become the problem. It‚Äôs like my baseline of anxiety got dialed up to 11. Which means that when a state anxiety trigger comes along, instead of just making me a little anxious, it can consume my whole day. \n\nSo the question becomes - when something happens in life that increases our trait anxiety, what can we do to get it back to normal? Or is that just the new normal, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúhealing‚Äù it back to normal? I have to believe there‚Äôs ways to get the trait anxiety back to more normal levels. I feel like I‚Äôve experienced some progress in this already. It‚Äôs just such a slow and non-linear ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù process. ",

Whenever they called or tried to talk to me It's like i would get annoyed or felt like they were bothering me and just tried to end it quick. But now that i've come to the realization of how much of an asshole I was, all I do is think about my parents and what I can do to help them and to spend as much time with them and telling them about my day or asking about any family plans coming up that so that I could go with them.  I could be described as someone who is far from having any anxiety. Always kind of strolling along and getting by with never really worrying about anything. With this, I've come to realize how fast time is moving and and that they are aging. Every day all I think about is my parents health. The smallest cold or sickness that they have my heart instantly drops and my brain jumps straight into the worst outcomes and all I think about is my parents passing and its scares so me so fucking much. This anxiety I have for their health is so draining and I feel like it makes happy family moments not as enjoyable because I know anything can happen to them at any day.

I can see that his teachers don‚Äôt fully understand him, and it breaks my heart because I just want him to feel confident, happy, and supported.\n\nWe‚Äôre in the process of evaluations to see if he qualifies for an IEP, but in the meantime, I‚Äôm considering enrolling him in the same after-school IOP program that helped his brother. It‚Äôs designed for kids with anxiety and groups them by age and similar challenges. The program meets two days a week for two hours, and I‚Äôm hoping it could help him develop skills and confidence while we navigate the school situation. (His older brother is in the day program though- which is more intensive) \n\nDoes this seem like the right level of care for an 8-year-old?

My question is anxiety focused but I'll include adhd and depression here in case anyone has any insight. \n\nI know I should do what my doctor recommends but where I am from doctors have a habit of being trigger happy. And tbh I have some reservations about being on medications for mental health even though I have been on mirtazapine for over 7 years. Given all this, I would just like to hear what you folks with experience with this stuff have to say about any of this. \n\nMy psychiatrist diagnosed that due to constant instability and trauma during my formative years, my sympathetic nervous system has gone into an almost constant state of fight or flight. This is where my anxiety comes from. And I agree with her. I have had anxiety for most of my life but it has increased quite a bit during the last few years which is why I am considering medication. However I have reservations due to possible side effects (both long and short term) and also chances of dependancy. \n\n  \nFor context, I am 24M. 90kgs. 6ft. I also have ibs. And I have been prescribed 20mg daily in the morning.\n\n  \nI'll ask the question that is giving me the most anxiety first. Can anyone shed some light on using propranalol long term and then coming off it successfully with your doctors help? Did it fix (or help) your anxiety after coming off or did it go back to the way it was before propranalol or get worse? \n\nOther than this, Some of the things I'd like to know from you folks are:\n\n1. For the kind of anxiety I have (by that I mean the source of it being a constantly over stimulated fight or flight response) is the Propranalol the right medicine? \n\n2. As I have read elsewhere on this sub - could it possibly suppress my fight or flight response too much to the point that it does not get activated when it needs to? \n\n3. What is the likelihood of long term dependancy? Has anyone been on propranalol for a long period of time and then been able to wane off it successfully with the help of your doctor? If so then did you anxiety symptoms come back after you went off it or did you feel like it rewire your brain to a certain extent? \n\nIs there any possibility that long term use of the drug diminishes the brains capability to perform the same functions without its help? \n\n4. I have read online that propranalol can possibly increase the risk of ADHD. Since I already have it and it is quite the bane of my existence, I am worried about this. \n\n5. What if any long or short term side effects has anyone here experienced related to basic things like sleep, weight gain/loss, sex drive and digestive issues. Beta blockers generally cause constipation, don't they? \n\n6. Can someone suggest some natural/otc alternatives in case I dont want to go the hardcore medication way? I mean supplements and the such. \n\n7. Can I take Propanalol on an as needed basis? Like just take it on the days I know I have anxiety inducing things on my page or do I need to take it regularly for it to work? To be clear I dont think my anxiety is limited to public speaking or social anxiety. It is more generalized. \n\n8. Due to my ADHD I have the tendency to actually be calm in disruptive situations and work better than others. Can propranalol hamper this? Because this is something that comes in very handy in the line or work that I am in. \n\n9. Also interested in hearing anything else anyone might have to say and any personal experiences with this.

Immediately I saw my optometrist and my exam came back normal with no detachment or anything of concern. I did learn that while my astigmatism appeared to be better, she said my far sightedness has gotten worse and wrote me a new prescription for glasses (which I don‚Äôt wear because I feel like I can‚Äôt see with them).\n\nStill had the pains & the floater then started having lots of headaches with pressure and burning sensations. Very sensitive to light (fluorescents & being outside on a sunny day without shades). Saw my ENT & she ruled out sinus issues via sinus CT which was normal. \n\nThe past 3-4 days I‚Äôve had a significant increase in the discomfort around my\nRight eye. It feels like something is pushing on my eye socket and my Right eyebrow and temple area feel like they are in a constant state of throbbing. I‚Äôve been trying tylenol and it doesn‚Äôt help. The only relief I have is when I‚Äôm sleeping or the first hour after I‚Äôm awake I don‚Äôt feel it then as the day begins it starts. Not sure if this is just another anxiety manifestation or something actually wrong. ",

        "text": "i had to put my beautiful baby girl down today at 17 years old. she was so healthy up into the days she passed and i don‚Äôt understand what happened. she was fine last week. this monday she was having a hard time eating but was still showing interest, wanting pets and cuddles, was going outside, didn‚Äôt seem unhealthy but still booked a vet appointment to be safe. the closest appointment was this friday. \n\nby today this morning she had been hiding in a new spot since the night before, wasn‚Äôt eating at all, wouldn‚Äôt purr if you pet her, looked extremely tired and could barely keep herself standing. she ended up peeing in the spot she was sleeping in. my other cat just passed 3 months ago, and she had the same symptoms but it was her thyroid so it was treatable, we just didn‚Äôt catch it in time as she was born with a thyroid disease that went undetected. we thought that was the problem, but it wasn‚Äôt. my mom brought her to the vet with me expecting she would get meds and be okay. she came back an hour later and said she was in kidney failure and had to be put down üíî. there was nothing we could do and no amount of money would fix her..\n\ni went up to the vet to say goodbye to her and the rest of the day had just been a blur. i‚Äôve been having panic attacks none stop and i just miss her so much. i can‚Äôt control my crying, everything reminds me of her. she loved to find new spots to sleep in, if a new blanket was on the floor she would sleep there for days until she found a new spot. she‚Äôll never find a new spot again, she‚Äôll never come running when i shake the treats again, she will never come outside with me in the backyard and play again, i‚Äôll never be able to give her cuddles and kisses and chin scratches again. i won‚Äôt be able to hold her again, i‚Äôll never feel her head butt my legs as i‚Äôm walking by, i‚Äôll never see her again :( i just wanna curl up in a ball and die. i miss her so much. i‚Äôve had her since i was 2 and now im 19. \n\ni don‚Äôt know how im going to get through this, i think of her and i immediately start bawling my eyes out. she was such a lovely, sweet girl. i‚Äôm gonna miss her so unbelievably much. i love you setty. i‚Äôll see you up there one day üíî",

I take it for extreme allergies.\n\nBut don't go preaching to the world about asking for hydroxyzine. It's just not a good idea to advertise any sort of medication as if it were some miracle drug.\n\nThere are some serious side effects from hydroxyzine and several contraindications. It's important to acknowledge that some meds work for some but not for others. And we don't know what other medications other people are taking.\n\nIf you are taking hydroxyzine then you should not be taking benadryl. It can also cause cardiac issues.\n\nYou coming in here singing praises from this certain drug that worked for you can be dangerous. Some people are more careful about trying new meds and that's good. Other people, not so much. The way you posted about this medication makes me believe that you are not aware of the adverse effects of the med. Which is dangerous.\n\nI'm glad it's helped you, but please be mindful of the fact that every medication comes with warnings and contraindications."

Also I'd like to preface I am in therapy, and they know about this too.\n\nI went to the doctor and was prescribed a 40mg dose of propranolol, tried it that day and felt quite calm - but I was in my safe space anyway, in my home. I tried it  again the next day and went to go take public transport to work and it felt kind of odd?\n\nI was not doing well that morning before I took it. I woke up in a panic and sweating and heart racing, so took it and about an hour later it definitely worked. But it felt odd because I was still anxious in my head but none of the physical things happened, it felt like I had something missing? I didn't feel the rushes or heart pounding or shakiness which I think made me feel a bit weird. I have quite bad health anxiety and agoraphobia so I kept thinking \"I'm gonna be sick\" / \"I'm gonna faint\" and humiliate myself in front of everyone and not be able to get home.\n\nDid it take you guys a bit to get used to this? I don't want the physical symptoms at all, but it was almost anxiety inducing to not have them. I came home right away and I did \"panic\" but I'm not sure if I'd call it a full blown panic attack.

                "body": "Well, You don't deal with it easily at first. Any step that makes it even 1% easier is paid for in stress, tears, and cold sweat. I used to have panic attacks when my health anxiety would flare high enough. At the beginning, 8 years ago now, I had panic attacks a minimum of 3x daily, for almost a year. Anxiety subsided over time, and panic attacks stopped as well, because I wasn't anxious.\n\nHowever, whenever anxiety would flare up again, physical symptoms would come back which would almost inevitably spiral into a panic attack. It was only recently that I became capable of feeling anxiety without freaking out into a panic attack. I would feel anxiety come as well as my symptoms, acknowledge them, let them do their thing knowing that when anxiety would subside, so would the symptoms. Because they're symptoms of anxiety, not of a health issue.\n\nIt took very hard work to ingrain into my mentality that my symptoms are anxiety symptoms, and not serious health issues. One of the grander steps was the realization that, honestly, no matter how bad they felt, they were pretty superificial and non-serious. It was my anxious state that would blow these symptoms out of proportion. All these stabbing pains, lightheadedness, sensations, whatnot, when You boil it down, it's all mostly just sensations and not actual symptoms. See, if I had thrown up instead of just being a bit dizzy, I'd have cause for concern. Had my leg gone proper numb instead of transient pins-n-needles feelings, sure, that's concerning. Pins-n-needles aren't. I have headaches because I'm under stress, not because I've brain cancer or what the fuck have you.\n\nYou have to accept uncertainty. Easy way or the hard way, but You have to. You have to forcefeed Your psyche that uncertainty is a fact of life, and so is death. People die. You too will die, so will I. Trust me, we are lucky to not be certain about our deaths, not everyone has the privilege not to know when and how they will die.\n\n  \nYou also have to de-train Yourself from Googling, researching diseases and whatnot, and body-scanning. Stopping Googling and symptom checking and reassurance seeking is straightforward, but maybe not easy always. However, it IS straightforward and as long as You put in effort, You will cut out this mechanism that easily affords spirals. If You feel a symptom, feel it, move on and do not bodyscan. If You find Yourself falling into these habits, You must make a conscious effort to stop them, which will later become a semi-conscious effort, until You completely stop engaging in these behaviours."

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nFor the last 2-3 months, I (18M) have started feeling anxious over everyday activities (heavy breathing, a sense of worry combined with a deep pit feeling in my chest, trouble sleeping‚Äîe.g., waking up hours before I am supposed to, being very alert and not able to get back to sleep). Though not socially, per se, I‚Äôd say that I am a very extroverted person compared to my peers. Recently, this has gotten worse; for over a month now, I have been worrying about nothing‚Äîseriously, nothing at all‚Äîyet my mind races, filled with worry and overthinking. My heart rate elevates, I feel overwhelmed, and my throat tightens to the point where I start to gag and feel like I'm going to vomit. These episodes can happen at any point of the day, even at work or while sitting on the couch relaxing, and can last for hours. They have begun to happen much more frequently, which is starting to affect my life. These episodes are more likely to occur when I am in social settings, even if it‚Äôs relaxed and I can keep to myself, like at an event where I start to over-worry and gag, which is unusual for me because I would call myself social (although I grew up as an extremely shy kid, but that suddenly went away a few years ago). During these episodes, I have been doing the standard breathing exercises I've seen online. They help somewhat, but still aren't enough for me.\n\nIn my personal life, no drastic events have taken place; actually, I‚Äôd say life is going very well. I've just finished high school with better-than-expected grades and am on summer break for a few months (I'm in the Southern Hemisphere). I have successfully enrolled in university to pursue a degree I have always wanted to do, without the stress of being able to pay for it either. To be honest, I feel guilty for feeling this way; I have everything going for me with all the opportunities I've been privileged to have while others are suffering more than me.\n\nI have spoken to close friends about what I am going through, and they say I am experiencing standard anxiety symptoms. But what do you think? Should I go to my GP with this? (I have a new doctor I have never seen and I am afraid this will get brushed over (I also would like to keep this private as I feel embrassed to be 'broken' and that I feel like this and I don't want to talk about it with my parents)",

I kept thinking on the way there will I feel dizzy/off balance, will i feel faint. These thoughts were constantly going around in my head like am I okay and will I get bad symptoms. I hardly thought about the actual Christmas markets or taking any of it in. \n\nEventually the it felt dizziness did happen and I felt off balance then it just snowballs my anxiety and I eventually had to go home. \n\nWhen I get home I notice that my symptoms always improve. Not completely but it's always more manageable at home like in my safe space. \n\nIt's frustrating because I used to enjoy going out and doing things all the time and now my constant fear about my health is taking over, restricting my life\n\nAnyway I have had numerous tests like brain MRI, heart tests and blood test. \n\nIt didn't really help because on my last visit to my doctors. I mentioned i still get these dizzy spells/feeling off balance. And she then suggested based on my description of how these episodes occur that she wants to check the vasculature of my neck and head with an cervical MRI with contrast because she said that although anxiety can do this there is a possibility it could be physical.\n\nI appreciate my doctor for being proactive and doing this for me. \n\nBut with health anxiety now it just makes me imagine the worst and I feel like those negative thoughts are creeping back in regarding my health. \n\nI don't really know what I was hoping to achieve with this post I guess I'm just looking for people who can sympathise with me üòÖ\n\n\n\n",

I have bought the supplements again but am still very unsettled. The doc also said therapy but i didnt like that therapist alot , felt weird and knew i couldnt work with him. \n I also have no time for therapy sessions cause my schedule is kinda jam packed and my parents dont genuinely believe in it or think i have any issues.\n They only bought me once to cope with some bullying in my prev school earlier this year.\n I feel like i have been caught in this loop of ocd where many months i am fine and a few months I am slowly going insane.

        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm writing this post because I feel like I don't understand my anxiety and wondered if anyone could help me understand it better so I could start working on getting it under control.\n\nI live a fairly normal life. I have a partner, a house, a couple good friends. Nothing out of the ordinary. Not massively close with my family but I'm not distant with them either. Didn't have the best upbringing family/relationship wise which I suspect is a massive factor I am like the way I am.\n\nMy main anxiety triggers are as follows:\n\n1. if we order food to be delivered, I don't like answering the door. I get my partner to do it 100% of the time. My body just won't allow me to do it, I don't even want to me seen by the person at the door. I *think* it comes from the driver once being confused thinking I was allowing him to keep the change as a tip (not common in my country) and there was an awkward interaction trying to explain I wanted my change. I am fine answering the door for anything else.\n2. I hate phone calls. If I have to ring someone, or ring a company for whatever reason, I really don't like it. I'll have to psych myself up for a while before making the call and then on the call I'll be shaking and sweating. After the call I'll be playing it over and over again in my head, continuing to shake. It'll take me a few hours to move on. If there's a live chat/email available, I will use that 100% of the time. This applies to having to go into places to speak to people as well, like into the bank or to customer services in a shop. But the phone is worse.\n3. If I have a slightly heated disagreement with someone I again become really uncomfortable. Even if it's just something small and forgotten about straight away. I'll start shaking and sweating again. I'll try to act normal and just get my phone out but I can barely use it as my hands are shaking. Again I'll rerun it in my head for hours before I fully calm down.\n4. I don't like compliments. I had a promotion at work a few years ago and I had loads of people telling me, quite enthusiastically, how proud they were etc and it made me feel really uncomfortable. I didn't know how to react and I responded with just a 'thanks' which probably came across rude. But again it's one of those things that I'd be thinking about it for hours after it happened, not being able to get out of my head how uncomfortable I was. I also struggle to give compliments because of this.\n\nI just want to be able to get past this and not dread every time I have to have some sort of human-interaction it seems.",

We have just enough to pay our bills. Something is wrong with our furnace and I swear our landlord is gaslighting me about it. I have all kinds of \"woman problems\" so I'm in constant pain 90% of the month, which coincidentally I feel gaslighted about as well because \"its normal\". And oh also custody court with my sons father literally days before Christmas so I can really drive home that my son has to stay away from his own father for the next two years for his safety.

Try therapy for a while and let your therapist help with the decision on medication.\n\nTherapy takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end. Therapy allows you to resolve some or all of the anxiety instead of only masking some of the symptoms.\n\n\nHere's a couple of tips to maximize success:\n\n‚Ä¢ Always¬†ask your therapist for homework in between sessions, something for you to work on. While the therapist only has one or two hours per week for you, you have all week to work on yourself.¬†You need to be invested in healing yourself.¬†The homework might sound stupid to you. Well, do it anyways.\n\n‚Ä¢ Never, ever¬†lie to your therapist. You will only waste your money, and waste both you and your therapist's time.\n\n‚Ä¢ Never, ever¬†hold anything back from your therapist, even if it's the most embarrassing topics (masturbation, etc.). If during a session some thought comes to mind, you share it, you don't hold back. It's as bad as point #2.\n\n‚Ä¢ Sometimes, people think that the therapist will just talk them out of their anxiety. This is not the case at all. I've had therapists do a whole session where they say nothing, maybe only a question or two. Somehow,¬†your¬†brain will lead you both on a path towards the root cause.\n\n‚Ä¢ Some people complain that they get a bad therapist. OK - happens in every profession. Go and find another that's a better fit for you. However, remember that they are not there to be your best friend or to mother you. They are there to help you find the conflict and heal.\n\nI hope you find your answers."

Then they should give you homework on things to try. Maybe keeping a diary, breathing, refeaming situations, small exposure to things that make you anxious, etc. etc. The idea is to retrain your brain.\n\n\nIt takes some time and effort, but can be really successful.

I knew right away it was a UTI. It hurt something awful. \n\nI genuinely believe you will know. You will have to pee every like 20 minutes at least your body thinks you do and the pain? It will hurt so bad you will genuinely debate trying to hold the pee for the rest of your life.\n\nI also had a little blood in my urine on like day 3. My mom is one of those ‚Äúit might get better if you just wait a bit‚Äù people so I was giving a couple days for it to clear up on its own.\n\nYou‚Äôd feel it. Especially if you were reaching danger levels. If you‚Äôre prone to yeast infections then yes that‚Äôs what the itching could be, but I‚Äôd also say in my experience those things itch so bad.\n\nBut with no symptoms and no test, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre most likely not suffering from a yeast infection, but if symptoms arise there is nothing wrong with going back or going to an urgent care if you can‚Äôt get into the doctor. I get it though. My first thought was also that it was going to go to my kidneys."

I know what my heart is capable of, I know what happens if you breathe incorrectly during the training and I'm not afraid of the these symptoms.\n\nBut that awful feeling of doom and utter terror is what gets me.

And yet somehow I have a hard time explaining it to the doctors, that panic attacks themselves are the \"saber tiger\" and they are very real. \n\nI would appreciate any tips. ",

                "body": "Congratulations on taking the leap! I've been on Zoloft for GAD for over a year (in fact, I just picked up my prescription refill a few hours ago). The first week was pretty awful. The second was better but still rough. By around the fourth week, I started to notice a real difference in my day-to-day mood. It didn't magically make all my anxiety go away, but it felt like I had more...space in my brain, I guess? Because I wasn't using up all my mental energy just to get through the day without being overwhelmed.\n\n\nYMMV, especially since you're increasing your dose fairly quickly. You could also consider asking your doctor if you could stay on one dose long enough to stabilize and work through the side effects before deciding whether that dosage works for you or whether you want to increase it. But follow your doctor's advice, not the advice of a random non-medical professional on Reddit ;) I will add, though, that if Zoloft doesn't work out for you, don't be discouraged. It just means you're one step closer to finding something else that will work better!\n\n\nFinally, while Zoloft and other similar meds can be a big help, they're not a magic pill or a cure-all. They work best when combined with other lifestyle changes like healthy diet and exercise, good sleep habits, and learning good coping mechanisms to deal with anxiety and any other difficulties in your life. If you haven't discussed any of that with your doctor, I highly recommend it. I wish you luck and hope it all works out for you!"

Also, how is Your anxiety lately? Flaring more than usual? Extreme levels? Or prolonged anxiety lately?\n\nI had gone through basically the identical spell. However, anxiety is really the only acceptable answer, and this can be two-fold. First, it can either be caused directly due to sheer stress. Second, it can be a condition caused by anxiety such as poor posture and muscle tightness in the neck, traps and shoulders. The symptoms are too mild and varied to be a serious physical condition, and they are hallmarks of anxiety or anxiety-adjacent physical conditions given their presentation. I would say the vertigo was the worst part of it all for me, in that it was the only one that actually affected me in any meaningful way. However, all symptoms have since subsided, dizziness lasting the longest. It varied in intensity, but that is alright. If I had been truly sick with something, I'd legitimately be falling the fuck over, and puking.\n\nI did find that stretching my neck muscles and traps helped, You should try the same. Stretch the front of Your neck, back, sides (which is basically an upper trap stretch). Posture work is required, also.\n\nNote however that it is very possible that none of the above is the correct answer and it is very possible that it may just be too much stress, which You can quite literally only wait out, easing the process with mood-lifting activities with which You are probably very acquainted with. I cannot overstate the importance of these physical, social and mental activities. Do engage in them as much as possible in life."

(TRIGGER WARNING THIS NEXT SENTENCE) it sometimes makes me have the thought of just taking myself out because at least that way i would know. i can‚Äôt stand being at the mercy of fate/the universe/potentially life threatening circumstances that are out of my control etc. i understand how irrational that is because obviously death is something nobody can or will ever have certainty on except very specific situations (like terminal patients) but i can‚Äôt function anymore in life because of this. it feels so imminent and true that i just simply don‚Äôt have much time left, like I‚Äôm going to just suddenly drop dead of some random health anomaly or ill just randomly slip away by either passing out and falling into a coma/dying right then and there, or it‚Äôll just happen in my sleep. there is NOTHING that can distract me from this.. i try grounding myself in the moment‚Ä¶ watching tv‚Ä¶ listening to music etc. sometimes it can work just barely, but the unsettling underlying feeling is ALWAYS there. literally always. i also struggle with undiagnosed ocd/magical thinking and am thus unable to tell if my feelings are just that or if its actual intuition. to make matters worse, i live in america with no money or insurance which takes therapy entirely out of the question. i‚Äôve told several people in my life about this underlying feeling of impending doom and they all insist its some kind of spiritual awakening which makes the magical thinking worse, especially given the severe depression i‚Äôve been in the last few years. i also always will find ways to convince myself that once i finally do accept death and the uncertainty that comes with it, that THATS when it will happen (ridiculous ik) i just cannot seem to get a handle on this anxious obsession and its completely destroyed my life. i even got labs taken earlier this month to rule some things out and everything was seemingly normal.. i just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point, just venting i guess.

I have nausea, dizziness and rapid heart beat along with insomnia and sweating. I've had shortness of breath in the past as well and they are all tied to mental health. I'm middle age and have had a ton of tests done for...all the exciting things that come with the territory of being middle aged and aside from high triglycerides, I'm in decent shape. So all of my symptoms are from GAD and yours likely are too.\n\nMaybe don't focus on seeing a doctor that is going to run tests and do things that make you uncomfortable and instead see a psychiatrist who can prescribe meds that will help with the anxiety. They'll ask you to fill out some forms and questionnaires about symptoms and that is it. And you can do telehealth appointments so you don't even have to go to their office. If you start treatment and see these physical symptoms fade and it may be that with lowered anxiety you'll also lose some of your fear about seeing a doctor in the future, should the need arise."

There is a genetic test, Genesight, a mouth swab DNA test that can ID which meds might work best and cause fewer side effects based on your genetic profile. Not sure if you want to get into all that or not. There are also non-SSRI medications like propranolol that can help with the physical manifestations of anxiety, but, like with everything else, some people have side effects. I can take it no problem, my partner got depressed on it. Buspirone is another one that typically has lowered side effects relative to many other medications. \n\nLots of trial and error with meds unfortunately. Anyway, you're welcome and good luck."

So days are busy as you can imagine, I leave the house at 7:45 AM and don‚Äôt return till about 8 PM, until 11 when i go to bed i do homework.\nI have diagnosed anxiety and depression, and have been recommended medication by two different therapists and my own doctor. My main issue is worried about is grades, as I have a deal with my mom that if she pays for my equestrian endeavors, I pay for my own college (by use of scholarships and whatnot). but she also makes (or tried to make) me get straight A‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm going to make the quota this year. I have two b‚Äôs which is essentially a 3.75. I cannot convince my mom this is a good GPA and i feel like she will never be proud of me. Talking about it turns into an argument, I just don‚Äôt know what to do, I can‚Äôt be proud of myself for anything and I feel like a failure to my own parents even though I tried really hard, but she won‚Äôt ever see it or notice. I know most scholarships aren‚Äôt available until senior year but i‚Äôm so stressed about what if i can‚Äôt find any or anything like that. Finals coming up doesn‚Äôt make it any better, last year first semester finals i was so stressed sick i was dry heaving in the school lobby and at home, I couldn‚Äôt eat the entire day all because i had an algebra II final.\nI just can‚Äôt stop thinking, about everything, not even school, just the future and anything life has up ahead. My brain won‚Äôt shut off, anything and everything I do i‚Äôm scared. Everything I used to find fun I can‚Äôt even think of doing because I feel unworthy of being able to do it and any ‚Äúanxiety attack‚Äù tip i try just doesn‚Äôt work and it just spirals out of control until i go to sleep or start mindlessly doomscrolling on my phone to distract, it‚Äôs unfortunately obvious too and i feel like everyone around me knows i have anxiety, I pick at my skin, pull out my hair, lashes, brows, and constantly fidgeting. I feel like a fawn stuck in a bear trap 24/7.\n\nTL;DR I am up all night, sobbing, literally, over a 3.75 GPA and how my mother will view me.",

                "body": "I don't have a story of \"getting rid of the anxiety diagnosis.\" Instead, my experience has been more about learning how to cope with the anxiety so that it doesn't control my life. That might sound counterintuitive, but a big insight for me has been recognizing how much anxiety in my life has been caused by judging my emotions or reactions. Feeling like I \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" feel a certain way - for example, I \"shouldn't\" feel anxious and thus anxiety becomes something I need to get rid of by any means possible - actually backfires and makes me more anxious. My \"success story,\" instead, has been about learning to be aware of my emotions and accept them without judging them - yes, even the \"bad\" or unpleasant ones. When I don't feel threatened by my anxiety, it becomes much easier to manage. Even if I'm never totally \"cured\" of anxiety, I can learn to live with it because I realize that as much as it sucks to be in the throes of it, it's not going to hurt me.¬†\n\n\nHow to get to that point? For me, it's been a matter of therapy and learning mindfulness exercises. And it definitely hasn't happened overnight. Baby steps.\n\n\nI don't know if any of this is helpful when you're in the middle of a really rough patch, but take heart! There are ways out of this dark place you're in right now. It may take some time to find what's right for you, and you might still have some level of anxiety or it may pop up here and there in the future. But you can and you will make it through this!"

If I try and look just day by day it‚Äôs hard to see the progress. One day will feel horrible, the next decent, then pretty bad again. But when I look week over week and month over month I can see the improvement. At first I just would notice once in a while a few hours of a few days started to feel somewhat normal. Then more hours of more days. Eventually I had a short work trip where I had a couple days where I didn‚Äôt notice anxiety hardly at all. Then it came back again when I returned, but not as bad as before. \n\nAll to say, with time and care it does feel like improvement and ‚Äúregular life‚Äù is attainable. \n\nMostly I‚Äôve just been working hard on a few key things:\n\n- work to understand the anxiety. Through therapy - try to appreciate what the anxiety is trying to do for me. Not to be as resistant to it. \n\n- work to move past the anxiety. Not to give it the loudest voice at the table. To take a more proactive approach to the day instead of a simply reactive role where the anxiety dictates the day. \n\n- I cut out caffeine and alcohol, and started drinking way more water and tea. I include some simple supplements in my tea, like valerian root and ashwagandha, to help manage my cortisol and calm my nervous system. \n\n- I also started taking magnesium \n\n- I started prioritizing my sleep schedule. Not obsessive, but trying to be very intentional about going to sleep at a consistent time every night. For me, that‚Äôs between 10:00-11:00. That typically means I choose not to watch or play anything very intense after like 8:00 or 9:00, to help myself start winding down. I switch to playing or watching something more familiar instead.\n\nI‚Äôm still very much on this journey. Anxiety still feels like a major part of every day. But based on this trajectory I‚Äôm hopeful that with another few months of intentionality and care , maybe longer, maybe less, I might be able to feel normal more often than not.

My doctors then, and now, have confirmed to me that what I described is not uncommon, especially for people with major stress and anxiety, and I have generalized anxiety disorder. \n\nFWIW when I just recently checked in other my doctor about the current bout of it, she was totally unconcerned about it as a problem in and of itself, beyond being a symptom of stress and anxiety, and just wanting to make sure I‚Äôm getting enough sleep. \n\nI‚Äôve done some causal reading into it and it sounds like it could be sort of like the sensory filtering functions that you have when you‚Äôre awake haven‚Äôt come online yet, I think they call it sensory gating, and so this raw input signal gets interpreted as buzzing or other weirdness until all your systems come online. As a guy coming from information tech, it‚Äôs like I woke up during the system POST test. I‚Äôve also read that it‚Äôs been hypothesized that your body may interpret the disconnect that happens from waking information from sensory systems and other bodily systems when you transition sleep states could be what triggers the sudden awakening because of the hyper-vigilance. Almost like it‚Äôs a fall. I asked my doctor about this stuff, and she said that‚Äôs what‚Äôs she‚Äôs heard about it as well.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt want to suggest anybody shouldn‚Äôt check in with their doctor if they‚Äôre wanting to check on it, but for right now/what its worth, I would guess if you have history with anxiety and stress, it‚Äôs probably like mine and other people‚Äôs I‚Äôve read about it. There‚Äôs definitely multiple posts about this type of issue on this subreddit."

Even though I can‚Äôt be bothered seeing people? It makes no sense.\n\nBasically anytime I have to decide about going out I almost never do because I break down in tears with being overwhelmed by the decision. You see - I could go out and potentially have a good time but there‚Äôs been a lot of times where I get depressed when I drink/see friends so I get scared that‚Äôs going to happen.  \n\nI hate this, I‚Äôve stayed in tonight yet again because I got so worked up about it and I feel bad because my boyfriend is in the same friend group and out with them, but he always feels so bad for me and I feel guilty that I‚Äôm partly ruining his night because of my fucking emotions.",

I recently started one of those jobs around 3 mths ago (back in late august) and the manager told me she could give me around 20 hours a week which I agreed to. Initially I had misunderstood when I would be able to start working the 20 hours (it turns out it would have been after two staff went back to school) so I feel like I already bothered her a bit back when I first started and it‚Äôs led me to be a bit anxious anytime I have to communicate with her now about anything. My manager is a nice person but comes across quite direct especially over text. I eventually did get those hours but she‚Äôs just posted the schedule for the next while and my hours have been drastically cut while a new hire (store owner hired another person while manager was away) and shes gotten way more hours than me for the next month. I‚Äôm not sure how to approach my manager about this seeing as I feel like I‚Äôve given her enough hassle already back in august (or maybe I haven‚Äôt and I‚Äôm overthinking lol!) My availability is 5 days at the stores which I feel like is enough to accommodate 20 hours‚Ä¶.\nAny thoughts? Is it valid for me to bring this up to her? Any suggestions as to how I should approach my manager in a non confrontational manner? It‚Äôs feels unfair to me that the new hire is getting way more hours than me‚Ä¶..\nThanks so much \n\nTLDR: New hire getting more hours than me despite open availability \n\n",

I don't know what you're reading or hearing, but it sounds toxic and it is certainly not representative of society as a whole. \n\nNo one even needs to know you're on an SSRI either. It is no one's business what medications you take but yours. \n\nAnd the idea that people that are on them are somehow weaker than others...what difference does it make? I mean, people drink, smoke, dip and do all kinds of drugs to cope with life and reality. You go on an SSRI and you're somehow weaker than a guy that is knocking back a 6 pack after work? An SSRI means you'll have a functioning liver in 30 years.\n\nI'll tell you a little about my father. He was, physically, one of the strongest men I ever knew. Worked as a lineman, smoked, drank, dipped and drank some more. Inhumanly strong. Mentally, he suffered from anxiety and OCD, and this was before there were meds that could treat him. He was miserable and he made me and my mom miserable and there was not enough alcohol and tobacco out there to treat his ailments. He died at 46 from a cancer that was almost certainly tied to his lifestyle habits. If he had access to an SSRI in the 1970s, he might still be here."

I did have a speech impediment partially related to this as a kid and underwent about 6 years of speech therapy, but it has never been this bad before, and it's not so much that I struggle with forming a specific sound anymore--I physically stop breathing when I try to talk and the words won't come out. Whenever *anyone* at all is listening to me I have this problem, even casual one-on-one's with people that I know and trust. When before I struggled with a few key sounds, now I struggle with many that have been causing this freeze. I can't even say my own name anymore without freezing a majority of the time. It is starting to derail my life. It's almost like I am losing the ability to speak on a physical level due to anxiety. I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled but am trying to gather some idea of what I can do before the appointment and would like advice regarding what medications I should look into, techniques, etc. Does anyone else struggle with something like this?",

To order groceries I need to walk to the building door which means I‚Äôll likely see people walking around or have the people at the office talk to me. There‚Äôs a communal kitchen which I cannot use so I‚Äôm limited to an air fryer where I live, microwave and toaster. Which isn‚Äôt bad but I can‚Äôt properly cook certain foods.\n\nI don‚Äôt go outside unless accompanied and basically forced. I‚Äôm always hyper vigilant and self conscious. I am not independent at all and it‚Äôs a massive problem. \n\nMy psychiatrist however told me I have self worth issues as most of my problems are with being seen, perceived or judged. And their only help is offering walking groups or telling me to up my confidence. They didn‚Äôt even give me an official diagnosis. \n\nAll social situations give me immense anxiety, I avoid them at all costs. Phone calls make me feel sick. I avoid making appointments if I have to ring. \n\nMy anxiety is so bad even in an emergency I can‚Äôt call services for advice or immediate help. I once overdosed and I was feeling incredibly ill and I was too anxious to go to the hospital. My anxiety isn‚Äôt just effecting daily life but can be life threatening. \n\nGrowing up I had other signs other than the typical social anxiety. A good example was that I was too anxious to even use the toilet in my home if anyone was home. In case they needed to use it and I was in the way or if they noticed I was using it and judged me‚Ä¶ regarding number twos I‚Äôd hold it in for over a month until I was home alone for a long enough period of time. \nAt my boyfriend‚Äôs shared house I was too scared to be seen so I peed in bottles. \nWhen I temporarily stayed at my grandads for two months I used my cat‚Äôs litter tray‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs embarrassing and disgusting but this is what I mean when I say it‚Äôs a genuine disability but it‚Äôs just labelled as social anxiety and self worth issues without any treatment or official diagnosis!

        "text": "Hi everyone, sorry in advance for my English, I'm not a native speaker. I just need to vent and maybe get some support. Or maybe someone could kick my ass virtually. Thanks.\n\nI'm a 29y.o. female, I suffer from anxiety and extreme panic attacks. My whole life I was dreaming of climbing up the career ladder, making lots of money and being independent. It was never easy to get out of comfort zones, but I was kicking myself in the ass to reach my goals. Panic and anxiety tried to stop me many times but somehow I got through it. Especially with my fiance's help, he's the best thing that ever happened to me and he helped me a lot during the periods when I was getting constant panic attacks (it was so bad that a couple of times I got my whole body paralyzed). \n\nSo I grew up really poor and was always dreaming to have a good high paying job, I started working when I was 16 selling eastern european street food in a marketplace. Then I was a waitress, bartender, then got an assistant job in the HR office when I was around 21. When I finished my tourism management studies I got a job in a travel agency, at 25 y.o. I got a job as a project manager again in an HR company, and now at 29 just a month ago I unexpectedly was offered a job as a head of process development in a big and serious company with such pay that I never could have dreamed of. I'm the bread winner in our family and with this job we could pay off our debt, travel and buy a house in a couple of years. Sounds like my dream did come true. \n\nBUT\n\nThis whole month that I was working here I was on the edge psychologically, there is A LOT of responsibility, way more than I expected, so much stress and I was feeling that it's too much for me and this whole week I was driving home crying from all the stress. It's mainly because I'm not used to that much of responsibility and there are A LOT of things that I don't know yet and it's driving me crazy. So today I snapped and told my boss that I don't want to work here anymore. I even considered being unemployed and for a couple of months just to relax my brain. My boss is very calm and supportive and after a long talk he suggested me to wait till monday and think of my decision through the weekend.\n\nSo I'm sitting here wondering what to do, I will never get this kind of opportunity again, I really don't want to mess this up and it's all I ever wanted (career and money-wise), but I feel like I will burn out quickly and will start getting panick attacks again. \n\nSorry for the long post, but maybe someone had a similar situation? How did that turn out for you?",

I havent had any weed since and this whole week Ive felt like everyone around me hates me and I also feel outside of my own body. Last night I had one of my bad dreams and Today in my last class of schoola all of my movements felt really slow and heavy. When I got home from school I was home alone and was out of my mind making weird humming sounds, crying, I was panicking on the floor and my dogs were in my face freaking me out. The only thing I can compare it to is recently in an exam my breathing felt really fast and I felt like everyone was looking at me. Right now I still feel weird but Ive definitley calmed down.

                "body": "Using weed as a coping mechanism is worse than bad for You. I smoked for years and years, on a daily basis, but never with the goal of feeling better about life, instead just going for the fun of it. Stopping smoking means You cut out Your coping mechanism and now have to face life in its raw form. The thing about smoking weed is that it trains You to be a bit too relaxed about everything, which is less than ideal for real life. A moderate amount of care, wariness and tolerance of stress is necessary; going into life without these qualities means You risk getting traumatized by stresses so intensely that they stick with You, and You compensate by being TOO anxious, TOO wary and TOO expectant of stress.\n\nI was not any older when I had smoked, however it does not change the fact that You are WAY too young for smoking weed. While I have never had withdrawal symptoms other than intense dreams, that does not mean someone else won't - especially someone who started smoking heavily at 13.\n\nMy advice is drop weed ASAP and consult professional assistance if Your problems persist, or get worse. Things may calm down, but You are obviously not equipped to handle life properly if You must rely on substances to get through the week. You may not need professional assistance if You get Your act together in time, but this will require You to become aware of the fact that You are abusing weed and not just enjoying it, and that Your mental state is compromised for whatever reason. It will also require You to take actual steps towards changing this, such as dropping weed until You can function properly without it, and afterwards regulating its use, and utilizing introspection and other forms of problem analysis in order to work on whatever put You in this state of needing weed to get through the week. However, offend You as this may, I believe someone of Your age simply does not have the required perspective and life experience to apply this to themselves, and I most strongly advise dropping weed altogether and getting professional help."

        "text": "26F\nI have had anxiety my whole life but have always self managed without meds. I tried sertraline for a few months at 19 but couldn't sleep and had constant headaches. About a year ago I had a knee surgery gone wrong in 2023 that resulted in a nerve injury and severe nerve pain, which I am still working on getting figured out. I then herniated a disk in my lower back and spiraled downward due to the pain. Sometime in there I noticed my arms and face started having burning sensations and was never able to find an answer to. I also have had trouble falling asleep lately. I have been tested for autoimmune disorders, with no noticeable answers. It feels like it is mostly anxiety/chronic stress causing these symptoms.\n\nIn July, right after my back injury, my doctor prescribed Cymbalta. It was helpful for anxiety, but not physical symptoms necessarily. I also had some bad side effects with it such as a racing heart and headaches. The withdrawal off of it was worse. I then tried buspirone, but it had no effect. My doctor then switched to Lexapro most recently, but I made the personal decision to stop as I fell deeper into depression and didn't sleep for 2 weeks, with no help. \n\nMy mom is trying to convince me I have fibromyalgia due to the arms/face burning, back pain and leg pain. She also thinks the not sleeping is part of it. I have bad health anxiety. I already looked at the symptoms of fibromyalgia and I don't think they fully match and feel like I just need to get anxiety under control better and allow my body to heal. I have a friend/medical provider who thinks I'm stuck in fight or flight from anxiety, as many of my symptoms don't always make sense\n\nHas anyone had any luck with finding a medication that worked for both the physical and mental aspects of anxiety that don't have bad side effects. I think cymbalta worked best but many of the nerve problems I experience are better in the summer so it is hard to be sure if cymbalta actually helped.\n\nTLDR: tried 3 meds(cymbalta, buspirone and lexapro) that didn't work. I have what I believe are physical manifestations of anxiety. Anyone have any good medications.",

Ever since I started, I‚Äôve liked the job itself but the people ruin it all for me. My manager is so nasty to everyone, including customers. I could go on a full rant about all of the things she‚Äôs said to me and other people but just to give you some perspective, she‚Äôs made me cry multiple times at work and she actively threatens to make me cry again every time I work with her. She plays things like this off as a joke in front of other people but it‚Äôs really affecting my mental health. I‚Äôm constantly drained and cry 90% of the time before I go into work, and even on my days off I‚Äôm anxious and overwhelmed about my next shift.\n\nShould I quit? I‚Äôm really nervous about quitting and being unable to find another job since it took over 3 months of me applying to jobs to get this one. I don‚Äôt know what to do, it‚Äôs starting to affect my daily life and mental health badly.",

        "text": "So I've been having terrible migraines for years and I finally decided to see someone. They decided it was best to get an MRI and let me tell you..  i FREAKED out when I heard that.\n\nMy thoughts were further freaked out when I heard its like an hour long, you cant move, its loud, the contrast can make you have an allergic reactions, etc etc etc. All that combined with having anxiety? holy shit\n\nBut to anyone curious, mine went totally fine! The anticipation was much worse than the procedure. Its not that loud with ear plugs, if its for your head you can kinda move your legs and arms and it helps a ton. I went for the little mirror that lets you see outside the machine. They give you a ball to squeeze and theyll pull you out quick but I never thought of using it.\n\nHonestly I almost fell asleep! It was like taking a nap tbh. Just take a benzo if you need it, but I think many could do without. Also wear some pajama pants with no metal underneath some regular pants. They let me wear them instead of a gown. Bring water your license and insurance info, and you WILL be fine! I did mri brain and neck with and without contrast, probably took 1 hr and when it was done you will think to yourself how did I beat myself up over this, totally easy you guys got it.",

I haven‚Äôt had a psychiatrist in 2 months now because my last one wouldn‚Äôt even up my dose of the antidepressant that wasn‚Äôt helping me. she just kept telling me I need to take walks for at least an hour a day . when i explained to her so many times I‚Äôm having trouble even leaving my house and that‚Äôs super overwhelming.

It‚Äôs been months like I said and nobody can seem to get through to anyone (my mom, me, my insurance company). My insurance company is saying if I get a psychiatrist to write to them with a prior approval for out of network care then maybe it will get approved but that‚Äôs super unlikely and also I CANT EVEN GET THROUGH TO ANYONE AT ALL ANYWAY. I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm at a loss üò≠üò≠ I can‚Äôt function and I just cry most of the time. I wasn‚Äôt doing well before but I‚Äôm getting worse and worse pretty much everyday.

        "title": "Progress in my first anxiety setback after years of feeling \"healed\". It gets better! Slowly, but it does!",
        "text": "Today marks 1 month and a half into my biggest anxiety \"setback\" or relapse, even if I don't really like that term, after approximately 3-4 years of completely manageable anxiety (after CBT and SSRI treatment for debilitating anxiety (GAD) and health anxiety, between 2018 and 2021). Since 2021 I had what I would qualify as \"normal\", average anxiety, ie some isolated bad days or stress caused by identifiable stress factors. \n\nA health anxiety trigger sent me spiraling mid-october, and it has been extremely humbling - and difficult, with all physical symptoms appearing, perhaps in some ways being even stronger than I had with my initial anxiety. \n\nAnd even though it's frustrating because today I still feel off, I am slowly but surely feeling better. I still have physical symptoms of anxiety but they're getting rarer and rarer. I still get frustrated, especially because I have a lot of expectations - \"I felt healed 2 months ago, will I ever feel healed again?\" \"I felt normal this morning, no symptoms whatsoever, but I tend to get a lump in my throat in the evening and - oh no, the lump is back\".\n\nThis is why I'm trying to have a new approach to my anxiety and its symptoms. I greet it like an old friend when it ramps up, apply the \"HALT\" check (which usually proves true with me, as anxiety messes with my appetite), and I recently got into Claire Weekes' technique which is very new and interesting as I've always tried to cope with my anxiety but never to \"float\" through it. It's hard to apply, but with each passing day I understand more and more how to \"think\" like so. \n\nAnd looking at my journal, I can see that this week, even if it has felt like I've been stagnating with \"mid anxiety, sweats, nausea and feelings of hopelessness\"... it is much better than 2 weeks ago when I would gag from anxiety, struggle to eat, have heart palpitations every minute and derealisation; or... the week before that, where I had uncontrollable bouts of crying, dread, panic attacks; or the week before that, where I thought I was back at the bottom of the ladder with all of this all the time. Hey, today I felt 100% normal for half a day! My morning anxiety (very strong when I wake up still) wears off when I get into my little morning routine! (when a few weeks ago it'd last the whole day, then the whole morning...)\n\nIt is getting better. I know my anxiety will always be there, but will little by little become a non-problem again and I will feel entirely like myself. I've known that, I know it's within reach. Take care of yourselves and trust yourselves, trust your body in its capacity to brunt through the days. Sending much love to everyone in the thick of it.",

I have yet to take it as I'm afraid it will change me and the side effects worry me.

        "text": "\nI‚Äôve had anxiety and depression for about five years now. I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed but I feel like this is something you just know you have when you feel it. \n\nWhen I first started having anxiety it was so horrible I couldn‚Äôt even leave the house (15F at the time, now 20F) and I had anxiety from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. During the Covid lockdown I actually did better since I didn‚Äôt have to go anywhere and my anxiety and depression calmed down as I was constantly surrounded by family and life was on pause for everyone. Going into my senior year of highschool was horrible for me and I was absent about half of the year due to my anxiety. \n\nMy anxiety is something that stops me from doing simple things, it‚Äôs a lot better than it was when I was 15 but even then it stops me from doing stuff. For example there‚Äôs still times when I don‚Äôt want to go anywhere because of this dull anxiety that clings to my nerves or going to the movies makes me anxious and I must bring earbuds with me in order to calm down. It stopped me from starting college until now and it makes me worried about my future. \n\nDepression is also something I struggle with, though my anxiety was always the main issue, the last few days it‚Äôs been my depression that‚Äôs been acting up really badly. Although it‚Äôs not as bad as when I was 15, it‚Äôs definitely worse than it‚Äôs been in a while as it‚Äôs been days since I started feeling like this. Whenever my anxiety acts up really badly I always think of going on meds but I never do (taboo in my family, my parents don‚Äôt understand this sort of thing) but my depression the last few days is making me feel so horrible I‚Äôm genuinely considering it. \n\nI very recently moved (it‚Äôs been about two weeks) and I think this is what triggered this huge depressive episode. Being uprooted from comfortability really set something off in me and even though I know it‚Äôs ridiculous (I literally moved across the street) I can‚Äôt help the way I feel. \n\nThe thing is, aside from my parents opinions (I live with my father and as I‚Äôm in school he provides for me and would be the one paying for any medication and taking me to appointments) I‚Äôm also really scared to go on medication. I did once go to the ER for a panic attack and they prescribed me anxiety medication but I never took it because I was scared of what it‚Äôd do to me, which is the main issue. I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôs going to make me feel worse as I‚Äôve seen so many people say. If I‚Äôm feeling depressed and anxious now I can only imagine what the wrong medication might do to me. I‚Äôm really hoping this rut of mine ends soon but it‚Äôs hard living like this and not feeling doomed, especially when I‚Äôm so busy with school and have about a million assignments due very soon.\n\nAny suggestions? Even just some comfort would be nice honestly. ",

My psychiatrist told me people usually need it if they've been having anxiety on regular basis for longer than 6 months. Though in the end it's doctor's decision to presribe it or not. But I'm sure you would be prescribed it. \n\nI understand you're afraid. Good thing is you can just stop taking it if anything. As a result any bad side effect or reaction would most likely stop very quickly. So in that sense you're not risking much by trying it. And if it ends up working, it's so worth it. To me it gave me my life back. Also you would probably be given secondary medication for more of a direct and immediate relief in case your anxiety got bad, so you could use that in case of a bad reaction. So it's like a safe guard."

I want to cry right now because for the last month or so I've been feeling all this and I'm not sure where it's coming from but it's definitely connected to horseriding and horses. I don't own or lease a horse. For now I'm just going for lessons.\n\nFor context you could read my previous post on r/equestrian if you're not scared of long stories, I posted about 2 days ago about this but I suppose I worded it wrong.\n\nThis heartsinking feeling has been here for a month straight now and I just don't know what to do. I think I've tried everything and it goes away only when I'm at the stable riding or near horses. Idk know why, good god I'm tearing up wth. I know you all aren't therapists and can't help, but I'm just hoping someone has any tips of getting better or just what to do in my situation or something else to say. I'm desperate at this pint.\n\nThe feeling is always there. At day it's better because I have school so I am distracted but when I have to go to sleep and don't have anything to distract my mind with I find my heart just racing andaching almost. Idk what this feeling is since I've never had it before now, but I'm guessing it could be anxiety...? Idk what to do.\n\nI'm not really a super anxious person by nature. If 5 was normal and 10 extreme I would be anywhere from 4-6 in level of anxiety. But lately I've been at 7+. I really don't know what to do.\n\nI just want to feel better.",

It was clear and he acknowledged before that he will look into it so I was put off when he asked me that question like I felt he is delegating it to me where in fact that is his responsibility and I'm just 1.5weeks in the company and no one has onboarded me yet on the processes so why would he even ask that question? \n\nShould I feel offended and feel that he is insubordinate? He also messaged me separately to lead a meeting he is suppose to lead and again I felt weird taking orders from him where I'm supposed to be one of the head of the team.\n\nI can feel he has a lot on his plate but I don't think what he did is right.

In August, I started having strange chest sensations, like palpitations that felt like they were coming from my stomach to my chest and would take my breath away. It happened with even the smallest exertion‚Äîcombing my hair or being in a fast-moving car triggered it. I went to the ER, but they said everything was normal and advised me to follow up with my primary care doctor.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt see my PCP on the weekend, so I went to his urgent care. He prescribed metoprolol for palpitations also since my bp was 137/85. The metoprolol seemed to help initially, but two weeks later, I started having shortness of breath and a feeling of chest constriction. I ended up in the ER again and was admitted for two nights.\n\nThey ran a bunch of tests:\n\nCT scans (upper chest and abdomen)\n\nEKG\n\nLeg ultrasound (my D-dimer was elevated, so they wanted to rule out clots)\n\n\nEverything came back normal. I was discharged with a diagnosis of tachycardia and dyspnea, but they weren‚Äôt sure of the diagnosis.  Hospital cardiologist told me to lose weight. Lost 40 pounds from August 25 to November 29. \n\nI‚Äôm still feeling the same symptoms, but they seem to worsen around ovulation. I feel so depressed because sometimes I can‚Äôt even lay flat without shortness of breath. Occasionally, when I take a deep breath, I feel a palpitation‚Äîit‚Äôs a sinking feeling in my chest that makes me sit up suddenly. I get stomach twitching like upper stomach. And I get internal vibrations like my back. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar or have any idea what this might be? Any advice or insights would mean the world to me.\n",

It was only at night, around supper that my body would override my stomach and say, you got to eat. It wasn't until I was crying almost daily, and then went to a counselor that things started to clear up. Once I talked through what I was feeling, and we identified the source of my anxiety (initial source) all of my stomach issues went away. Still, when my anxiety flairs up, I'll get heart palapitations, shortness of breadth, stomach issues, and even sweating. It goes away by the afternoon. My Dr said that anxiety can be a really powerful affect on the body. She's had people who had all of the symptoms of a heart attack, and it was a panic attack. So, maybe, try counseling. Talk it out."

I do breathing exercises but it doesn‚Äôt help much. I usually rely on sheer exhaustion to put me to sleep. \n\n",

If you‚Äôre seeing this and have navigated an addiction to benzos, that‚Äôs truly commendable, I‚Äôve had friends go through it and know it‚Äôs a bitch. That said, I have maintained sobriety from alcohol for three years, and I fully recognize the importance of exercising caution with benzo use. I have a diagnosed panic disorder, and my treatment team‚Äîpsychiatrist, therapist, and sponsor are all aware that I utilize a low dose (0.5 mg x 3 as needed) of Xanax. I do not misuse it. I‚Äôm not going to misuse it. I take it when it is absolutely necessary. \n\nAlright. So I‚Äôm debating whether to ask my psych to switch from Xanax to Klonopin, because I usually have to take 0.5 mg 2 or 3 times on a ‚Äúpanic‚Äù day, and at least in theory, it seems like one-dose of a pill with a longer duration and more gradual effect might be better suited for me. My questions are straightforward: \n\n1) For those who have experience with both Xanax and Klonopin, what differences have you observed between the two medications?\n\n2) Is it possible to take Klonopin, even at the lowest dose or half of the lowest dose, during the daytime without experiencing significant sedation that would hinder my performance at work?\n\nThose are the questions I am seeking feedback on. Nothing else. Thank you for your insights. \n",

I would not sleep or eat for days and would basically sit around googling symptoms and convincing myself I had every disease under the sun. If my results were even slightly high or low I would make myself sick with worry. If my scans came back clear I would be convinced they missed something big. Ive been 100% sure I‚Äôve had just about every disease under the sun at one point or another. And of course the c-word was my biggest fear or all. It got to the point where I just avoided going to the doctor because I couldn‚Äôt handle the anxiety. Every ache, tinge, bump (you name it) would like to a worst case scenario self diagnosis. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago when I started having some odd symptoms that landed me in the doctor. I had various tests done, didn‚Äôt eat or sleep for weeks while waiting on results and for the first time in my life the worst case scenario came to fruition. About a month ago I got the call from my doc telling me I had the big C. \n\nHere‚Äôs where things took the most unexpected turn of my life. At first I thought I was just in shock because I didn‚Äôt feel anything at all. Just kind or numb you know? In the weeks following all of my anxiety started to shed. The big thing I freaked myself about for years was happening and I was handling it like a CHAMP. I was sleeping, eating, laughing with family and friends and going to my appointments with optimism. \n\nThe moral of the story is‚Ä¶you are SO much stronger than you realize. Believe me. The chances of anyone getting a big diagnosis is low and VERY unlikely to begin with. But if the worst does happen, you are going to shock yourself with how your strength rises to the occasion. \n\nPlease don‚Äôt live your life in fear. You are full of health and vitality. Believe it. \n\nLife is a beautiful gift and should be lived to the fullest everyday. The day I received my diagnosis was the day I finally made the decision to start living. \n\nI believe 99.9% of you reading this will never have to receive that diagnosis. So do me a favor and make that choice for yourself today ‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "text": "Hey yall!! I just needed a place to vent and share my story a bit and the progress I‚Äôve been making, as I don‚Äôt have many people I can really share this with!\n\n6 months ago I made a total 180 with my life. I moved across the country, got engaged, and started a new more draining job. I started working immediately after the big move, as I‚Äôve always handled change in stride, but I guess this time around my body didn‚Äôt catch up quite as fast as my mind did. I ended up collapsing at work, legs non functional, brain having a weird feeling all over it, and had to go to the hospital right in the middle of my very first shift.\n\nI was told it was a panic attack, something I‚Äôd never had before. I hadn‚Äôt experienced any anxiety over anything but pretty typical things up until this point, although I had a small overdone fear of death due to being raised by a drug addict and a paranoid, doctor hating man who had his own issues too. This made me very, very against ever receiving medical help prior. I went to the ER three more times that week, begged for an MRI and bloodwork, and everything just came back normal again and again. I couldn‚Äôt believe a panic attack could make someone feel the way I physically felt. \n\nThis began a 6 month long spiral into my personal living hell. I had felt closer to death than ever before in that ER, with this constant ‚Äòweird feeling‚Äô in my brain in the back of my head especially, like something was misfiring. I kept hyperfixating on how I thought my brain would just snap or disconnect, like I‚Äôd start seizing any moment, but I never did. Thus, my health anxiety began to grow. I just couldn‚Äôt accept that I had randomly developed anxiety out of the blue and it could affect me quite so strongly. \n\nThe reality of this situation was that I had undiagnosed OCD, and this was my new hyperfixation. I had fixated on many things before, but this one brought great great great damage to me. Over the last six months I‚Äôve stopped being able to function almost entirely. I can‚Äôt enjoy car drives anymore, what if I crash? I can‚Äôt enjoy video games anymore, my brain might had a tumour. I can‚Äôt get routine blood work done, what if I have the big C? Every tingle, every touch, every little jolt, every typo, every time my ankle rolled, every time I missed my arm into my coat sleeve; is this a tumour? Is this an aneurysm? Am I losing my cognitive function? Why can‚Äôt I focus? Why am I so scared? I never feared these things before? What is my body trying to tell me? If I ignore this as a panic attack will I die and regret not getting help? All the same thoughts typical to health anxiety. \n\nToday, I started Lexapro. I got a full set of bloodwork done after talking to my doctor, finally. She thinks I could have hypothyroidism, I think I could be dying. The bloodwork, though, is probably going to come back with something that won‚Äôt kill me, if anything at all. All day I‚Äôve been reading stories of how life changing this medicine can be, reading stories of peoples lives changing. I‚Äôm worried, I‚Äôm anxious, still, that it won‚Äôt work for me. That I never had anxiety to begin with, this is all so freaking foreign and new to me, but the reality is that in 6 months nothing has happened to me and every result is clear. And it‚Äôs time to accept that I am healthy. Sort of. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt need help. \n\nIf this medication doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll move onto the next. I‚Äôm dedicated to keep trying until I find something that‚Äôs going to work for me, until I stop having to fear every twinge and every misaction and ever abnormal thought, and so that I can live again, and enjoy the things I used to enjoy to their fullest. I‚Äôm tired of stressing out and exhausting those around me, my fiance, my family and friends, and I‚Äôm ready to take control again and do what needs to be done to stop feeling this way. \n\nI‚Äôm scared of my blood results coming back. I‚Äôm scared of side effects from this medicine sending me into a spiral. I‚Äôm scared of ignoring these ‚Äòsymptoms‚Äô that the medication may give me and missing something important. I‚Äôm scared of having to try other meds if this one doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm scared this one WILL work and I‚Äôll be stuck on it. I‚Äôm scared. So scared. But it‚Äôs day one of this medicine, and after months of the gnawing I‚Äôm finally ready to do what needs to be done, and I‚Äôm so proud of myself for doing it. I will tough out any side effects. I will listen to my body. And I will trust that I‚Äôm ok, and young, and healthy, and I can be happy again, and I‚Äôll let the doctor who trained her whole life for this show me how. \n\nCompassion is so important to show to yourself and to others. I hope this helps me and I hope I can start to feel better, and if I don‚Äôt I hope I find something else that will. Above all else, I am hopeful, optimistic, and proud of myself for the first time in a long time. I can‚Äôt wait to feel better. ",

        "text": "So, as the title suggests, I'm in quite a bit of anxiety lately.\n\nI'm just 19 (born in 2005) in a somewhat developing part of the world (southern Brazil). I have experienced what massive flooding due to climate change is and how politicians here in general (both on the left and the right) generally use climate related issues as populism to gather votes first hand in May, as I nearly lost my house (water was just 50 cm from entering my house). Since then my anxiety due to climate change has skyrocketed.\n\nI've seen the past Climate Action Tracker that show that \"the most likely scenario\" is a 2.7¬∫ C increase and what this means. I know what policies in the US holds in regards to fossil fuels (despite bipartisan lawmakers being quite fond of the IRA). I've read some articles such as those by Brian O'neill that claim the trends in poverty/hunger reduction and longevity increase will continue despite climate change (Nature Magazine \"Envisioning a Future With Climate Change\", 2023), and also Hannah Ritchie's articles regarding her recent book, but also how badly these were received by the scientific community. Who can I trust, then? Is everything going to be on a downward spiral of doom or is it going to be average?\n\nI can't help but always have this feeling that it's useless having hope. I dream of having children, having dogs, being the one who will retire my parents and traveling the world, but what if all of those efforts are all for nothing and our current society collapses in my lifetime (conflict due to resources, famine and poverty increasing significantly year on year)? Heck, how can people say my generation will live over a 100 years?\n\nI tend to spend my time when I'm not at work or college to search things on Google to give me hope, but everything points that I will either live in a dystopia or not even make it past 40. There are somedays that I can't simply pay attention at anything because my brain is on a downward spiral.\n\nSo, what I'm trying to say is: can someone who works in fields that are related to the climate change issue (energy, agriculture and infrastructure specially) say something that calms me down? Is it really that bad as it seems? I just don't want to see civilization collapse during my lifetime. I want to have reasons to believe I will get to meet my grandchildren, be 90 years old, this type of thing, that says to me that it isn't a lost cause and I have a future to look towards to.",

Climate change is indeed terrifying and I don't work in the field so I can't give you hard data or anything but I can tell you some things that help me now several years later; \n\nSTOP reading articles looking for hard answers. This is reassurance seeking that will only make anxiety worse because even though we have data and projections we do not have ANSWERS. There will never be any article that says \"hey you you're going to live to be 90 don't sweat it\" because we simply do not know. And the hard truth is you are going to have to live with that uncertainty and try to make a life for yourself DESPITE not knowing. Its the only way. Remember projections and forecasting is good for planning and taking action but it is not a crystal ball and as you point out reports are conflicting anyway.\n\nLive your life IN SPITE of the fear. I am considering starting a family soon myself and the future feels so grim sometimes I wonder why bother but honestly we HAVE to live for today. I look at all the things that scare me about the future (war, flooding, earthquakes, pandemics) and I decide to live my life IN SPITE of these fears. Tell these fears to go fuck themselves, you're young and you're going to live your life! Suck it climate change! Obviously I'm not suggesting you become a nihilist or a hedonist but when those fears cloud your brain telling yourself you're going to  be brave and live life despite them has helped me immensely. \n\nAnd further to that, I'll admit I don't know a lot about Brazil but there must be a LOT of like minded young adults taking action. Are there environmental groups you can join? Protests you can be a part of? If you feel safe to do so of course but linking up with like minded people who are taking action (and not just doom mongering) helped me so much and it may help you too. Finding people who feel the same way you do and who are being proactive will help give you a sense of power and purpose. \n\nI hope you're able to keep safe and I'm sorry your home is at risk that is a type of anxiety that is outside my purview but I wish you the best and hope you stay safe. Best of luck DM if you'd like!"

One that calmed me down in a bit is a projection by the FAO that crop yield per acre rises in a business as usual scenario up until 2050 (their maximum range in projections) while harvested area and hunger rates basically flatline.\n\nAs for protesting, not that big of a fan but mostly due to some personal disagreements with a few political groups being too extreme in my country. Not going to sugarcoat anything on either side of politics. I've seen what some right-wing lunatic such as Bolsonaro can do but also how much harm a left-wing populist, someone like Lula can also so.

        "text": "\nHi everyone,\n\nAbout three weeks ago, I had two severe anxiety or panic attacks (I‚Äôm not sure what they were exactly because it‚Äôs the first time that i‚Äôve experienced this), and since then, I‚Äôve been struggling to feel anything. I no longer feel love for my boyfriend, my friends, or even my family ‚Äì people I cared deeply about before these attacks.\n\nThe first week after the attacks, I couldn‚Äôt leave the house, go to school, talk to my boyfriend, or even eat and sleep properly. I‚Äôve been able to manage my anxiety better since then, but what really makes me anxious now is the fact that I don‚Äôt feel any positive emotions anymore. Every time I think about people I care about or my boyfriend, it just makes me feel anxious and stressed.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? How did you cope with it, and do you have any advice for regaining those feelings? I just want to feel connected and positive again.\n\n",

I've never had any history of medical or mental problems in my life of 56 years, never had to stress or worry about anything in my life except for this and it appeared out of nowhere. Been to the doctors a bunch of times and they scanned everything except for my head? They just want to chalk it up to GAD but it's not like these symptoms come and go, they are constant. Gave me Propanolol but it only makes me more tired and weak and my pain in head is still there and makes me dizzy sometimes even just sitting on couch. I can't believe as far as medical this is the best we got for treatment. Try this and try that for a month or two and if it doesn't work your suffering the whole time and when you try something else and hope you don't have any withdrawal from the previous med you tried which makes you suffer even more and they don't want to prescribe any benzos to help you through it. But if I go to the ER they want to shoot me up with Ativan and send me on my way. I've never done any drugs iny life and I still don't but I'm starting to lose my sanity. Pisses me off cause doctors just seem like they don't care about patients. They set me up to see a psychiatrist in March, I'll probably need one by then."

This was new to me, and freaked me the fuck out. Still, as symptoms go, it's a minor symptom and if it doesn't progress into inability to walk or whatever, I was not to worry. It didn't, and I didn't worry no more. It passed, then came back, then passed again.\n\nYou convince Yourself that it's just anxiety most easily by accepting the fact that none of Your symptoms are disruptive of Your day-to-day life, and therefore are minor symptoms. Serious illness WOULD BE VERY DISRUPTIVE TRUST ME. People who are unsure whether it's anxiety or something serious can always bank on anxiety.

Having control of everything is impossible. Instead, try to focus on what brings you happiness and joy, day to day.\n\nAnytime I feel my body‚Äôs alarm going off, and there‚Äôs no real danger, I take a brisk 30 minute walk or I will calmly walk and shake my arms, hands, shoulders - this disperses the energy\n\nAs a last thought - check out the D.A.R.E. podcast.

The stress builds up for days. We look ahead at the future event and it paralyzes us; we may even miss the event and cause a great rift between ourselves and our lover. \n\nThe ultimate fear is that our anxiety and mind will ruin our lives forever. One facet of which is its ability to ruin our relationships. \n\nThe first thing I want to point out is that BEING OPEN about your mental health struggles at the beginning of the relationship is paramount. You MUST leave it all on the table. If they stay, good. If not, good. We anxious ones need people who understand the complexities.\n\nThe second thing I want to point out is that your significant other WILL NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND. The question is not whether they understand. The question is whether they are willing to accept who you are. If they encourage you to fight anxiety, good. If they add guilt upon guilt to ridicule you in your fear, bad. \n\nAnd the last thing I want to point out is that love is still possible for you. Anxiety is not all of you. Remember that! \n\nPlease share advice or suggestions on this topic in the comments. ",

(But still I had a small concern that why I don‚Äôt feel horny?!)\n\n- Day 10 of marriage (during our honeymoon), without any prior notice, she started yelling at me, talking in the most insensitive way, that I don‚Äôt have sex with her enough times, that I don‚Äôt ever initiate it, that this is not satisfactory for her in any way or form, all this while yelling and backlashing, and that her friends‚Äô husbands made love to them a lot more, and that she isn‚Äôt experiencing that like them.\n\n(I was devastated the way she talked to me, if she told me that in a nicer way, more gentle or calm way, I wouldn‚Äôt feel any kind of hurt or anything, I would simply comply and tell her that this is new to me also, and we need to communicate more)\n\n- I told her maybe I should check my hormones or smth, and that we would fix that, but I never got over that fight, after two other months of fighting over small stupid things, I told her that I don‚Äôt want to have sex with her, and I don‚Äôt feel safe in this relationship, in which she didn‚Äôt try to make any effort to fix.\n\nWe finally got divorced, our marriage lasted for 16 months or so, and in the last 7 months or so, we didn‚Äôt have sex at all, I avoided all forms of physical intimacy in the last 7 months with her. \n\nI feel really great getting out of this relationship, everything is so good, except for the libido thing, since that awful confrontation, I lost all my confidence and connection with my sexuality, I‚Äôm super anxious all the time that something is wrong with me, I don‚Äôt feel horny at all, I don‚Äôt even remember how it feels to be horny, it‚Äôs really the only thing that I think of almost all the day, everyday!, I feel so bad that I might never feel that again!\n\nI masturbate only to make sure that everything is working normally.\n\nI used to be horny if I saw an attractive woman, now I see that she is attractive, but I almost feel nothing!\n\nIf I masturbate to po*n, I feel anxious that I‚Äôm not really horny, why I do this?, and these thoughts take me out of the moment, and makes me extra anxious.\n\nI did hormonal tests and penial Doppler, and everything is normal!\n\nI did take SSRI in 2020 for like 5 months, but my libido suffered in 2022 mainly!, as I have read about PSSD, and I freaked out!, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me?!, I‚Äôm hesitant to approach any woman, even traumatized that I don‚Äôt know if my libido would be a problem, would the same thing happen again, what is even the point of approaching any girl, if I don‚Äôt have a sex drive!, I feel miserable!\n\nAny tips or advice?\n\nTL;DR: my libido is gone, and I‚Äôm super anxious all the time because of it, and I don‚Äôt know what to do!",

He just quickly looked at my heart with an ultrasound though.\n\nThe past couple weeks I've had new symptoms; almost daily tingling in left arm, sometimes throat, sometimes nausea and pain around my heart area. I think the heart pain is muscle pain but not sure.\n\nToday I am having an elevated anxiety attack for the last 6 hours. It comes and goes. Tingling in left arm, pressure/burning in chest, tingling an tightness n tongue and throat, disorientation fatigue. It seems different because when I do physical exercise it does not seem to help, and may actually make it worse.\n\nI did swim 30 minutes intensely twice this week, and no cheat pain during. Did not seem to impact my symptoms on the days I did swim. I don't have them much waking up, they develop about 5 hours after waking up, peak middle of day and hang around rest of the day except when I'm very relaxed at night.\n\nI checked my BP and pulse. Pulse is 80 resting and BP is 115/70. Usually I'm 125-130/80.\n\nSeems strange to have lower blood pressure at increased pulse and adrenaline constricting my left arms veins.\n\nSo any thoughts on all this? I actually have my first psychiatrist appointment Monday, I had just about convinced myself that this is all anxiety and now I start to get this different kind of attack.",

        "text": "Obviously this wasn‚Äôt done every single time, but the phone checking. I really didn‚Äôt like that and felt it was an invasion of my personal space and the trying to log into my snap on your phone. You denied it at first until I had to show u a legitimate email I got from your phone trying to log in. \nIt also made me feel uncomfortable to leave my phone alone with you and made me feel like u were trying to/ going to sneak behind my back to try to find things, look through messages with people, etc. It made me feel untrusted. \n\n\nI also feel like there were a lot of things that you could do and get away with, but if I did it it would‚Äôve been a big fight. For example, if I were to text Gavin about anything between us bc he‚Äôs a friend you would‚Äôve flipped out on me, but when it came to Chandler I was ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù and it‚Äôs no big deal. I didn‚Äôt like the unfairness. Or like ik if I were to ever walk over to a guy for a cigarette at the bar you would‚Äôve flipped at me, but it was no big deal if you did it. Like I know you got mad that I was talking to Asia‚Äôs cousin at the bar even though I knew him, but if u were to talk to a girl you knew at the bar it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. \n\n\nI also really didn‚Äôt like repeating myself either. You‚Äôd make me stg, promise, or just repeat the same things over and over throughout a week and it got exhausting, especially when something minor would happen, like a change of plans, and you would use it against me. \n\n\nI feel like you got jealous a lot too. Like if more of my attention was on my friends or something else you would be upset with me. You‚Äôve told me before ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my gf, if u actually liked me you would‚Ä¶‚Äù. I felt like that was a little bit of gaslighting and I really didn‚Äôt like that. \n\n\nI felt like you were also very dependent on me too. If I made plans w my friends before I made plans w u/didn‚Äôt invite you bc I just wanted to be w my friends u would get upset at me and I never understood why that really affected you. That wasn‚Äôt necessarily an issue that always happened, but I noticed that. \n\n\nI also didn‚Äôt like that u would try to make me jealous or try to get a reaction out of me sometimes. Ik it happened the night at whataburger when you talked to those girls all night, the girls with the cigarettes at the bar, bringing up Jaci and talking about her ass or how she‚Äôs pretty or how you saw her. Those were turns offs for me and I felt disrespected. \n\n\nI also felt disrespected by the way you would talk to me sometimes. The night of my birthday and the text messages you sent me that night at the bar were not okay and should not be how you talk to a girl. The call we had the other night when I didn‚Äôt come over you were whining to me and yelling at me the next minute. That made me uncomfortable. \n\n\nI also really didn‚Äôt like how you would show these behaviors or start arguments in front of my friends at the bar too. It made me feel embarrassed, especially when they would try to talk to you to make u see that you‚Äôre in the wrong or upset over nothing and you wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge it or you would just say ‚Äúthey‚Äôre your friends. they‚Äôll side with you no matter what, or lie‚Äù. \n\n\nI also didn‚Äôt like how I had to tiptoe or cater to your feelings over mine more often. I feel like most things were about you and had to align with your feelings over mine.  Like the night of my bday. You told me something along the lines of ‚Äúshow me attention or else‚Äù or you kept saying ‚Äúbro fuck it‚Äù when things didn‚Äôt go your way or if I was busy. I really didn‚Äôt like that.  ",

I don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve this. I‚Äôve tried anxiety medications, but nothing seems to work.\n\nHas anyone else ever dealt with this suffocation feeling 24/7? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs hyperventilation syndrome, sensory motor OCD, or something else entirely. I just want to live my normal life again without being constantly aware of my breathing or feeling like I‚Äôm suffocating.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been through this, please share your experience. I feel so lost and don‚Äôt know where to turn. Any advice or understanding would mean so much right now.",

Every time I stood up, I thought I‚Äôd pass out. Diagnosed with just anxiety and there was no other root cause.\n\nI started to get better, actually got in a relationship (that‚Äôs ended‚Äîanother story for another day). \n\n2021- I become a travel CNA. Left Georgia to go through Pennsylvania, Maine, NC, back to Georgia. I was fine until 2022, it hit me again. I was walking down the halls (florescent light gets to me I guess), and I felt out of it, went into a panic attack and left for the house. \n\n2022- it gets worse. I now can‚Äôt go into stores for long before I get hot, then dizzy, then dissociating. I have to leave, then it goes away.\n\nIt‚Äôs thanksgiving, and I had to leave my dads early because I felt like that. Now it‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt want to be around nobody. I‚Äôm 35, no kids. Needing to date so I can have a family before it is too late. But I‚Äôm so comfortable being single, that I don‚Äôt want to do it. I‚Äôm comfortable being alone, which isn‚Äôt healthy. I have to take my anxiety meds before I even go to work. Or do anything. I‚Äôm crying typing this. It‚Äôs thanksgiving. I should be thankful. But instead I‚Äôm crying because life should be worth more. I used to be fun, outgoing. Now I‚Äôm a shell.

In other words, they also can‚Äôt respect me as who I am. I‚Äôm probably also not very respectful to their need of communication, so, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to make so much effort to make it possible in all ways. \n\nI miss the old days when telephones were without incoming records, we wouldn‚Äôt come back to our phones and get stressful about who and who had called you. And if someone called and the other person didn‚Äôt pick up on the other side, it was also casual, it wouldn‚Äôt spike so much emotions (except maybe a little for the caller in some urgent cases that they couldn‚Äôt find whoever they need to speak to instantly). \n\nI don‚Äôt know if any of you shares the same thoughts. I found it easier if people could just call me to say what they want to say than sending meaningless messages for the sake of getting you to respond. I would treasure more a quality 3-min call when the two persons are engaged in the very present moment over a text message that someone might just quickly pop you when they‚Äôre on the toilet. And the latter is more often the case of nowadays. ",

        "text": "The evening of Halloween I had a very disturbing dream. I witnessed my own death and the heartbreak of my family in the wake of it. I watch my daughter and son grow up with no father. I watched as my wife remarried and gave herself and her love to another man. And at the end of the dream, just before I woke up a dark figure told me ‚Äúdeath is coming‚Äù. My hands are sweating and trembling just thinking about it. \n\nI am pagan. I believe on the evening of Samhain (Halloween)  the vail between the worlds is at its thinnest and those from the other world can interact with ours. Take that as you will but I believe I‚Äôve been given a message. \n\nEver since that day my health has started to decline. I‚Äôve developed a heart issue where my heart beat shoots up and then drops and then shoot‚Äôs up and again and then drops, all in the course of a couple seconds. These episodes last for hours sometimes. My blood pressure is higher than normal and during the episodes has shot to 161/93. I don‚Äôt normally get too far from 120/80 as I am pretty active. I even had one of these episodes on my birthday. I had brown spot develop on my hands for no apparent reason. I get muscle cramps like crazy. My insomnia is terrible. I‚Äôm sweating profusely for no reason. My health generally feels like it is failing. \n\nI have been to the doctor and they didn‚Äôt know what to do. They gave me a run of prednisone for the brown spots thinking it may be a fungal infection and told me they it would take weeks to go away. It literally disappeared in a couple hours. \n\nThe strange thing is I haven‚Äôt had an actual panic or anxiety attack since the incident on my birthday even though my anxiety has been very high. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not looking for advice per se I just needed to vent to someone who will listen to me. My mother keeps telling me I‚Äôm just worrying myself sick and that I just need to relax but I literally feel like I am dying and there is nothing I can do to stop it. \n\nFor the record I do have another appointment with my PCP on Monday and a Cardiologist on Wednesday so hopefully I can get some answers. I‚Äôm just worried I won‚Äôt make it until then. I spent all night with chest pain and didn‚Äôt sleep because I was scared my wife would wake up to find me dead. \n\nEdit: I wanted to add that after spending most of my life wishing for death, I am not scared to die. I am scared of leaving a wake of chaos behind me when I go. I am scared of my daughter not growing up with a father to teach her the proper type of partner to marry. I‚Äôm scared of my wife never recovering from the depression of the losing the man she committed her life to. I‚Äôm scared of my son not know the proper way to be a man, or worse being forced to be a man too early and not being able to be a kid. Worst of all I‚Äôm scared of never knowing my unborn baby boy.

I'd add on there the feeling of impending death which could be described as a feeling of impending doom. Not sure on the blood pressure readings--anxiety can cause short term blood pressure spikes. I guess wait on the cardiologist on that one, but don't be surprised if their tests come back normal too. Plenty of people link chest pain to anxiety--that is one I have not experienced, but this subreddit is filled with people who have called ambulances and been to the ER for a feared heart attack and found out it was anxiety.\n\nNot to dismiss your experience, but if you get the all clear from your cardiologist and PCP, I think you need to consider you have health related anxiety and seek treatment via medication and therapy. You already mentioned having an anxiety attack on your birthday, so anxiety is in the mix no matter what."

Instead of seeing them as failures, he started viewing them as opportunities to improve.\n\n**4. Seeking Support:** Therapy and ADHD coaching gave him practical strategies to manage his emotions and focus better. If you can, consider reaching out to a professional or someone you trust.\n\n**5.** **Small Wins:** He celebrated even the smallest successes, which helped build his confidence and kept him motivated.\n\nYou‚Äôre already showing incredible strength by wanting to stay and improve.

It's good that you're leaving the house to go to the convention though, even though you're feeling the anxiety symptoms. \n\nExposing yourself to this feeling and doing it even though you feel anxious is a great way to conquer it. The more you leave the house and expose yourself to the world, the easier it gets. I did this in college, I forced myself to go in public and I would sit and read a book or have lunch by myself, and over time it went from being a very scary thing to being a totally normal thing I was able to do. It's important to push yourself so your body and brain realizes being out of your house isn't a threat, and it's something totally survivable and okay. \n\nYou're at the perfect age now to expose yourself to things like this so that as you go into adulthood, the anxiety doesn't take too much control of your life. I hope you have a great time at your convention!"

        "title": "My Ativan Experience ",
        "text": "I have been consistently taking Ativan for 5 years now. I admittedly would often take a little more than I was supposed to. My prescription was one to two 0.5mg tablets as needed for anxiety. I would take it daily and sometimes I'd take 3 a day. Once in a blue moon I'd take 4. Of course this led to my pills running out early before being eligible to get a refill so the days leading up to getting a refill were a bit of a struggle since I'd have to ration them. Ativan was extremely helpful to me but I realize now that my body had became very dependent on it. A few months ago, I changed insurance companies which required me to get a new psychiatrist. This new psychiatrist did not want to continue my ativan prescription unlike my old one. She explained that ativan is only meant to be taken short term and that prolonged use can increase risk of dementia (which is terrifying) she planned to ween me off Ativan while giving me alternatives like Buspar and Propranolol. I was upset and uncomfortable about this but I understood her reasoning. Before trying Buspar and Propranolol, she tried giving me Klonopin as an alternative but I hated the way it made me feel. I felt light headed, dizzy, and I felt like it increased my anxiety while at the same time sedating me which felt very uncomfortable. She prescribed the previously mentioned medications instead and a very limited supply of Ativan if I really needed it. I was very uneasy about it but honestly... I've been okay. The Buspar takes a few weeks to take effect so I don't think I've felt anything from it yet but the Propranolol seems to be doing the trick. My main issue with anxiety is physical symptoms and she told me that Propranolol will take care of that. I no longer feel the need to have Ativan like I did before. Seldomly, I will take one on days when I feel my anxiety is high. But it's only one. Not two or three or four. And those days are becoming more seldom as time goes on. I have now realized how dependent my body was on Ativan and now that I'm without it (almost), I recognize that I'm okay. I just wanted to share my experience.",

I can't burp so I repeatedly swallow to \"clear the obstruction\" and to breathe. However, I cannot get a break to breathe because one after the other the bubbles keep surfacing... I cannot keep up. It is like my throat becomes a volcano filled with pressure and I absolutely cannot stop it. The bubbles make my throat feel closed like it's hard to breathe and I just keep panting and swallowing repeatedly while pacing. It gets worse and worse and I will do this for about an hour barely breathing. The air builds up so much that all of a sudden I feel like something more is coming up, it coul be bubbles or liquid it's hard to tell really, but I feel it crawling closer to what feels like my airway by the second. Eventually I have to breathe, but when I do, I feel like whatever is coming up whether bubbles or liquid, touches what feels like my larynx and suddenly I am gasping for air and the world is spinning. I'm pacing and panting like a dog and my throat feels insanely tight. I don't have a tickle or urge to cough so I wonder if it really does go to my airway? I am not wheezing during these attacks, it just feels so tight. I also don't have redness or a sore throat if that matters. The attacks always end with a huge burp. I have aerophagia (air swallowing) due to anxiety and since the aerophagia triggers acid reflux, I can't tell if this is an aerophagia symptom or an acid reflux symptom.\n\nCan anyone tell me whether they get this?\n\nI don't need advice on what to do for acid reflux diet wise or medication because none of that makes a difference. It is solely caused by my anxiety. I just want to know whether others have this too and if I'm going to die. I have a fear of choking so please be as non triggering as you can please.",

What you‚Äôre describing could be related to heightened anxiety or even an overactive stress response. When we watch or hear intense stories, our brain sometimes struggles to differentiate between perceived threats and actual ones, which can leave us feeling unsafe even in secure environments.\n\nHere are a few tips that might help:\n\n**1. Limit Exposure:** Avoid content that triggers fear for now and stick to shows or news that feel safe and comforting.\n\n**2. Practice Grounding:** Try deep breathing or mindfulness exercises to calm your mind when uneasy thoughts arise.\n\n**3. Reframe Thoughts:** Remind yourself that what you watch is separate from your real-life safety.\n\n**4. Talk It Out:** Journaling or discussing your feelings with someone you trust can help ease the fear.\n\n**5. Consider Support:** If this happens often, a therapist can provide tools to manage these feelings better.\n\nYou‚Äôre taking a great step by addressing this‚Äîthings can improve!"

        "text": "\nI‚Äôm struggling as a parent right now and could really use some input. Back in April, my 10-year-old started having panic attacks and refused to go to school. It was a really difficult time, but he‚Äôs now in a program that seems to be helping, and we‚Äôre starting to figure things out.\n\nNow, my 8-year-old is facing his own challenges. He has ADHD and anxiety, and it feels like everything we went through with his older brother has made things even harder for him. He goes to school every day, but he‚Äôs clearly struggling. He avoids work, cries during tests, and has trouble working independently. I can see that his teachers don‚Äôt fully understand him, and it breaks my heart because I just want him to feel confident, happy, and supported.\n\nWe‚Äôre in the process of evaluations to see if he qualifies for an IEP, but in the meantime, I‚Äôm considering enrolling him in the same after-school IOP program that helped his brother. It‚Äôs designed for kids with anxiety and groups them by age and similar challenges. The program meets two days a week for two hours, and I‚Äôm hoping it could help him develop skills and confidence while we navigate the school situation. (His older brother is in the day program though- which is more intensive) \n\nDoes this seem like the right level of care for an 8-year-old? I‚Äôm just trying to prevent him from reaching the same crisis point we faced with his brother. Any advice or personal experiences would mean a lot.\n",

My manager is a nice person but comes across quite direct especially over text. I eventually did get those hours but she‚Äôs just posted the schedule for the next while and my hours have been drastically cut while a new hire (store owner hired another person while manager was away) and shes gotten way more hours than me for the next month. I‚Äôm not sure how to approach my manager about this seeing as I feel like I‚Äôve given her enough hassle already back in august (or maybe I haven‚Äôt and I‚Äôm overthinking lol!) My availability is 5 days at the stores which I feel like is enough to accommodate 20 hours‚Ä¶.\nAny thoughts? Is it valid for me to bring this up to her?

        "title": "If You Brush Your Teeth Every Day, Here's Why You Should Do the Same for Your Mental Health",
        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nA few years back, I was juggling a demanding job, personal relationships, and the lingering effects of anxiety that had led me to over 50 therapy sessions. One morning, as I was mechanically brushing my teeth, it struck me: I never skip this simple act because I know neglecting it leads to cavities. So why was I treating my mental health any differently?\n\nAfter diving deeper into psychology (I'm currently pursuing an online master's in it!), I realized that We often wait for a crisis before we pay attention to our mental well-being, but just like dental care, mental health requires daily upkeep.¬†\n\n**The Overlooked Daily Practice**\n\nMany people aren't aware that our brains naturally focus more on negative experiences than positive ones‚Äîa tendency known as the **negativity bias**. This means we often dwell on what's gone wrong and overlook what's gone right. The good news is that by practicing daily mental health habits, we can train our brains to become more positive. This works through **neuroplasticity**, which is the brain's ability to form new connections and change over time based on our experiences.\n\n**Simple Ways to Incorporate Mental Health into Your Routine**\n\n1. **Morning Reflections**Instead of immediately checking my phone in the morning, I spend five minutes asking myself:\n   * How am I feeling today?\n   * What's one thing I'm looking forward to?\n   * What can I do to make today enjoyable?\n\nThis sets a positive tone for the day and helps me stay mindful.\n\n1. **Evening Gratitude Lists**Before bed, I jot down three things I'm grateful for. They can be as simple as enjoying a good meal or chatting with a friend. Studies show that gratitude can increase serotonin levels, improving mood and promoting better sleep.\n2. **Mindful Moments**Throughout the day, I take short breaks to practice deep breathing or simply observe my surroundings. Even a minute of mindfulness can reduce cortisol, the stress hormone, and bring me back to the present.\n\n**Resources That Have Helped Me**\n\n* **Books:**\n   * *\"The Power of Now\"* by Eckhart TolleThis book taught me the importance of living in the present moment and helped me understand how much time I spent worrying about the past or future.\n   * *\"Atomic Habits\"* by James ClearA great read on how tiny changes can lead to remarkable results, reinforcing the idea that small daily practices matter.\n* **Podcasts:**\n   * **\"The Happiness Lab\" with Dr. Laurie Santos**Explores the science of happiness with practical advice on how to live a more fulfilling life.\n   * **\"Where Should We Begin?\" with Esther Perel**Offers deep insights into human relationships and personal growth.\n* **Apps:**\n   * **LePal**Created by a close friend of mine who worked at Google and faced severe depression. She wanted to help others who can't afford or are hesitant about therapy. LePal features a ‚Äúspirit pet‚Äù that makes your mental wellness journey less lonely. I journal with LePal before bed, and the spirit pet replies with insightful feedback, which motivates me to keep going. There's also a \"therapy planet\" where you can talk about your feelings to help restructure your mind. Plus, it sends weekly letters about your growth. You can add friends and family for support, strengthening your support system.\n   * **BetterSleep**Sleep is a cornerstone of mental health, and this app has been a game-changer for me. BetterSleep offers a variety of sleep sounds, guided meditations, and bedtime stories that help me wind down and ensure a restful night. Incorporating quality sleep into my routine has made my morning reflections even more effective.\n   * **I Am**This app sends daily positive affirmations straight to your phone. It's amazing how a simple message like \"You are enough\" can shift your mindset. These reminders help counteract negativity bias and keep me focused on the positive throughout the day.\n\nMaking mental health a routine part of your day doesn't have to be overwhelming. Small, consistent practices can lead to significant changes over time. Just like dental hygiene prevents cavities, daily mental health habits can prevent emotional burnout.\n\nYou're not alone on this journey, and it's okay to start small. If you have any practices or resources that have helped you, feel free to share them. Let's support each other in making mental wellness as habitual as brushing our teeth.\n\nTake care, everyone! üíô\n\n",

I have had similar success with daily routine. Starting in the morning with some quiet reflection sets a good tone for the day. Gratitude at night reinforces all of the things that didn't go wrong even when our brains tell us they almost certainly would have. \n\nJournaling is another one that helps me. I write down my anxious thoughts. Something about putting them on paper helps me to see them for what they are. Like, wow, look at those; that's ridiculous. That's obviously not true.\n\nAnother app I have really liked is DARE. I highly recommend it to everyone.\n\nAnd lastly, diet and exercise. Running has been a huge help for me in burning off excess energy from having a sedentary office job. And cutting way back on caffeine and sugar makes sure I'm not feeding the adrenaline beast."

They don‚Äôt deserve the power we give them. Typically, people who actually want to act on these things, do something about it and don‚Äôt get obsessive over said thoughts. \n\nA professional can help you find ways to break that tie to you and the thought.

What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don‚Äôt see a psychologist because my anxiety isn‚Äôt severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

They won't be able to \"get over it\" because their brain is malfunctioning and needs more than just \"positive vibes\". And while they're out there trying to fight anxiety away, they're walking towards not only making their disorder worser but also developping depression.\n\nUnfortunately, I only learned about all that *after* I was diagnosed with both GAD and chronic depression. By that time, around six years ago, I had been living with both illnesses for over a decade without knowing it due to pure lack of information. Although I no longer fit the conditions for clinical depression, I'm still in treatment due to anxiety, and probably will remain so for the rest of my life. And I don't mind. After over a decade slowly and unawarily walking toward self-destruction, I'm glad I'm still here. Just wish I could've been diagnosed sooner and started treatment sooner."

I had a pretty intense (traumatic?) experience a few months ago when one of my dogs suddenly got very sick and passed away, paired with a few other things. One night right after that I had a panic attack, and nothing has felt the same since then. I‚Äôve felt the intensity in my chest, nausea every morning. Worried thoughts and rumination about all the ‚Äòwhat ifs‚Äô. In many ways now it feels like I‚Äôm just anxious about being anxious, instead of about any specific memory or thought. My body is just extra sensitive to worry, drawn to anxiety. Before I might have read something about someone getting bad news from a doctor and felt sorry for them. Now it immediately spikes my anxiety and I notice my heart rate increasing. Or I notice my remaining dog acting a little different and I start to worry. I described it to my therapist as it feeling like my anxious part got zapped with gamma radiation, and now when it‚Äôs just trying to do its normal job of anticipating problems, planning, helping, it goes into hulk mode gripping into my gut and chest.\n\nBut, I have felt significant improvement over the past four months. Life is not back to normal. ‚ÄúThe only constant is change‚Äù. But I do feel hope that some new version of normal will come with time. I gets tastes of it some hours of some days. And more hours of more days each month. Many days still feel like the best I can do is try and get through it, but the glimpses I get if my mind feeling clear again - feeling like the lightness returns to my heart and mind, and I‚Äôm not even thinking about the anxiety. They give me hope and motivation to keep going."

Also doing light exercise helped get some of the nervous energy out. Do you have any hobbies, or have you thought about starting one,  that involve your hands?\n\nTotally up to you, but therapy has also been super helpful in learning to deal with it and finding out where it came from. \n\nI'm sure you'll get a lot of good advice from the community, so hopefully something will help!

I did an online mindfulness based CBT programme called Silvercloud through thr doctor, it was really helpful. \n\nThe other thing that really helped me was doing this relaxation app daily called Sorted Mental Health. There are lots of different ones but the doctor also recommended me that one and it's evidence based and has the option of birdsong over the guided relaxations which I really liked. \n\nAfter I got over the worst of my anxiety and understood what was happening I started to try to make a mental note when I felt bad, like \"OK I'm feeling anxious, now what\" and I found that this often reduced the power of the feeling, more than when I tried to distract myself or push it away. \n\nThat starts to retrain your brain to knowing it's actually safe. You can say to yourself that you are safe, anxiety can't hurt you etc and find a way to talk to it. \n\nSome people also recommend squeezing an ice cue or rubbing ice over your face and neck to diminish panic attacks. And somtimes just jumping up and down, signing, dancing etc can help as your body is like OK I'm actually fine. \n\nAlso walking in nature, going to do things which aren't too stimulating. Stopping caffeine etc all helped me too. \n\nWish you the best in feeling better soon!!"

Everytime i come home from college, i have this shortness of breath that i cant shake. Well, my cat sleeps in my bed 24/7. she lives in my room because my moms dogs would slaughter her. My bed is a literal HAYSTACK of hair. like hair EVERYWHERE. And after some googling, ive found that breathing in an excessive amount of hair can \"irritate your airways and cause coughing, discomfort, or even mild breathing difficulties\". I am convinced i have been breathing in so much cat hair from this animal that it has made my life this past week an anxious hellhole. I am BEYOND convinced.\n\nI scheduled an entire docs appt next friday, and i go back to school Sunday. If im feeling back to normal i am going to be SO mad but so damn happy that i was worried about nothing. \n\nThanks for the rant lol.",

Once I moved out and got on my own, I was binging every weekend. That turned into binging on some weekdays. Eventually, it was everyday. I was a heavy drinker for three years or so, and for probably 1.5-2 of those years I was drunk daily. \n\nPanic attacks and anxiety run in my family, and once I got sober something in my brain got messed up and sent anxiety into overdrive. \n\nI've been 100% alcohol free for 3.5 years now and never looking back. Unfortunately, anxiety is still here and I'm still getting panic attacks. Medication has helped some but I don't know if my brain will ever be normal. \n\nHeart disease is also one of my biggest fears. Any little odd sensation in my chest sends my anxiety skyrocketing, which stinks because chest pain/stiffness is an anxiety symptom. So it's a really awful cycle. \n\nYou aren't alone OP.

Most of these things do not come naturally to me at all and I really struggle with simple things despite having a job for a few years now. I also really struggle with job interviews and selling myself, especially as the job market is so competitive and the salaries where I live are low compared to the cost of living (I am not in a specialized or lucrative industry). I try to avoid thinking about it but the idea of having to do this for the rest of my life fills me with so much dread. How are the rest of you who struggle with this coping?

                "body": "I have had similar anxieties related to work/career in the past.  Currently I have a corporate office job.  I am introvert who tends to lack self-confidence, and I generally don't fit in well with corporate culture where extroverts and those good at networking are the ones who tend to get ahead.  \n\nI also can never really force myself to be enthusiastic about work.   I work in an interesting industry, but I find it very unfulfilling.  To me it will always be just a paycheck, and just something I have to do 40 hours a week to keep a roof over my head.  \n\nWhat helped me a lot is to just stop caring so much.  I make sure I do my job well, but I don't stress about being perfect, or fitting in to corporate culture.   I came to realize that it's irrational to constantly fear losing your job over minor imperfections, because it is a huge hassle for a company to interview, hire, and train a new person to replace you.   \n\nSo I do my job to the best of my ability each day, I go home at 4:30, and then I try not to think about work at all until the next morning at 8:00.   I don't stress out about making an occasional minor mistake, or generally not being as extroverted and enthusiastic as everyone else in the office.  If the company decides that they don't want me to work for them anymore, oh well.  At the end of the day it's just a job.   You'll find another one if you have to.   I am 41 years old and i've gone through a few career changes since I entered the workforce, both planned and unplanned.  Things have a tendency of working out when they need to.  \n\nIt also helps to have some hobbies you can immerse yourself into on the evenings and weekends.   Gives you something to look forward to, and helps you not to think about work as much.  If you are constantly stressed about work, then it tends to spill over into your personal life as well.   What also helped me a lot was seeing a therapist and being able to discuss these issues."

        "text": "This might sound a bit strange and I feel like I‚Äôm alone in this, but I have a GAD and I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress recently. I had a chiropractic maneuver the day after Labor Day which caused severe pain at first and has now become consistent chronic muscle tension. I‚Äôve been to PT for two months and my therapist agrees that, if I did sustain an injury from the maneuver, it shouldn‚Äôt be severe enough as to linger this long ‚Äî as such, I‚Äôm thinking that this constant neck and upper back pain, tension, and stiffness is from my GAD.\n\nWhat I mean to ask is: has anyone experienced a relatively minor event being turned into a pain-anxiety cycle and being totally blown out of proportion by your anxiety? I genuinely feel alone and crazy here and it would be great to even hear a single person sharing a somewhat similar story.\n\nI started Lexapro two weeks ago, and though my IBS has gotten a bit better my muscle tension is still ever-present.",

        "text": "I was on 100mg sertraline for many years and made the switch to Lexapro 20mg in Feb of 2022. 2 months later I was in a car accident and had a severe concussion. All the symptoms I had after that I contributed to the concussion and injuries, but when I lowered my dose slowly from 20mg to 10mg starting June of 2024, so many things got better. A lot of my joint and body pains that made exercise difficult, memory issues, emotional blunting, etc. I felt great on 10mg for 2 months. I was able to do long walks/hikes with no pain, was feeling emotions with no panic, was making better decisions, cooking more, lost 10 lbs, increased sex drive, etc. \n\nThen after 2 months on 10mg (after the taper,) I had a breakup with my partner of 6 years, beginning of October. My anxiety and depression are BAD. I know some of this is normal, but it‚Äôs really, really hard to cope. I‚Äôm barely sleeping. I wake up with debilitating anxiety and cry randomly throughout each day. I‚Äôm ruminating. Have tried twice a week therapy, daily meditation, daily walks, seeing friends, a tropical vacation, all the things. Still suffering badly. My emergency Valium is barely helping. \n\nHe wants a few months apart before reconnecting ‚Äúas friends‚Äù, and I‚Äôm hoping to reconcile. He‚Äôs super active and I know that my physical limitations on 20mg were difficult for him. But also my irritability and such with mental illness. I just want a balance of mental and physical health‚Ä¶ so I don‚Äôt know if I should go back up to 15mg or try to ride this out? I wish I knew whether I had a chance at reconciling because it feels like the unknown is what‚Äôs pushing me over the edge. \n\nI know that bouncing is not a good idea and I had very difficult withdrawal symptoms, so if I go back up, it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôd go back down. I‚Äôm so stuck on what to do. I made the original switch from sertraline due to bad side effects (brain zaps every day, needing to push in order to urinate, and other issues.) I‚Äôm very prone to side effects with meds, and I just want to feel okay without major issues. But I really need to feel okay because I can‚Äôt live like this long term. Should I go up to 15mg or is this just normal grief? No one is able to tell me what‚Äôs normal‚Ä¶ not even my therapist or psychiatrist. She‚Äôs leaving the decision up to me. ",

Stand outside in the cold, hold an ice cube, wash your hands with cold water. Try your best to read a book, or do something you like or used to like- it can take 10 minutes to overcome the beta blockers in your mind to really enjoy something. Do something that will really distract your mind, like counting back from 100 in 3s, sounds silly but it works. Uhhh, drinking tea, I've found ginger tea is soothing. A hot tea or a hot bath/shower, it's comforting for the body. Remember to eat well and drink enough water and sleep well. Stretch before bed, develop a night routine. Connect with nature, really focus on the things around you. You can do this, stay with us, friend üí™\n\nThe heaviness in the heart for me has gone away but it took a lot of acceptance. Accepting that it's there. I've been told mine is because of my body storing unresolved trauma and I've started trauma work to try release all of that built up trauma.

I had to call a family member to come over because I have 2 sweet little girls I stay home with and I was worried I would pass out. I went to the ER and ruled out the bad stuff and was sent home and told it was anxiety. I hadn‚Äôt been feeling anxious prior to all this so I didn‚Äôt feel great with that diagnosis. Since then I have been to the ER 4 more times and given the same answer. I have a constant feeling of not being able to breathe and I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs panic disorder at all‚Ä¶. I thought panic attacks lasted 15-30 mins and then passed. However, the feeling of not being able to breathe has been persistent. I am constantly yawning trying to catch my breath. My jaw is sore and my chest is sore from struggling so hard to breathe. It gets worse when I eat and first thing in the morning. I have been prescribed Xanax and I take .5mg when I feel really out of breath- although I try to avoid taking it if possible. I am suffering 24/7 with this feeling. I don‚Äôt want to be on Xanax forever. I want to feel like I can breathe again. Since eating makes it worse, I haven‚Äôt eaten in a week.

I sometimes feel like I need to yawn/inhale but can't get a big enough breath in, and I keep taking deep breaths and getting increasingly wound up because none of them \"feel right\". I used to get it while trying to sleep and would have to get up and walk around to make it stop, it was so annoying. If you search \"air hunger\" on this sub you'll probably see a few things you can try.\n\n\n\nFor me, I stumbled across a video a while ago that described a technique where you¬†take a deep breath in, do a few more short gasps in, then exhale. In my experience most breathing exercises make this feeling worse but the weird gasping thing satisfies it somehow. It also helps me to focus on breathing into the belly instead of the chest."

Now that that's out of way -- \n\nI've seen a lot of \"coaches\" advertising on TikTok for their programs and courses and it just sort of gives me the ick. I'm sure these people want to help and are helping people in their own way, as a lot of people are vulnerable looking for guidance, but seeing some of these coaching courses are thousands of dollars just doesn't sit right with me. And what I mean by that is, if you're going to do that, invest that kind of time and money to better yourself, I feel like an actual licensed professional is a way better option so you can explore things that a person without psych training could never go as in depth in. \n\nMaybe it's just me, maybe I'm just being critical but I hate how some people who are in a low and vulnerable state just trying to better their lives and are desperate for relief might latch on to that instead of the other option because it seems less \"intimidating\" or whatever. \n\nThere's also a lot a wonderful free material online too if self help is your jam. But I do understand that some people need someone to guide them. \n\nThere's one girl on TikTok that shows up on my fyp that I legitamitely can't stand because of her just regurgitation of buzz words that are hot in the mental health space right now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm happy they got to recover and want to help people, but why skip going to school to become a licensed professional when you can just slap the word coach next to your name and skip all that time and money in school learning CBT and other modalities that people actually might need for their situations. \n\nI don't get it.

I have had an incredibly stressful month or so and it has led to a considerable anxiety relapse. I'm talking nocturnal panic attacks, almost constant nausea, waking up with my heart racing panic attacks. There have been some legit stressors: adopting a puppy (we now have two dogs), a big fight with my bf (which is since completely resolved and over, we're 100% fine + we've been living together for 1.5 years), the holidays, and now two sick dogs (both have kennel cough from the shelter dog we adopted). Nothing too crazy. Other than that, just a lot of work and a lot of social demands - I have like 10-15 friends who I text with daily (I've lived in 6 different states since college, so I end up making more friends every time I move) that I'm feeling totally burnt out from, even though I love them all. I've been feeling burnt out between my work, social, home, and dog caretaking responsibilities. I feel the need to be \"perfect\" in the way I take care of it all and it's exhausting. \n\nAnyway, I feel crazy. Not like \"I'm seeing things\" crazy, but rather I just don't feel like myself. I'm irritable, oversensitive, panicky, and on edge. I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping. I feel strangely disconnected and anxious around my loved ones. It feels like one more ounce of stress or responsibility would send me into a nervous breakdown. I feel scared to go out, which is super unlike me. I'm nauseous and tense. \n\nMy biggest fear in life is losing control of my mental health and subsequently letting everyone down (parents, boyfriend, friends, work peeps, clients, etc). I am terrified that one day I'll \"go crazy\" and no longer be able to do all the things I need and want to do. These thoughts really do feel so real and threatening that I'm in an almost constant state of fight or flight. Normally I'm able to calm myself down after an hour or two but this has been nonstop anxiety.\n\nI often get this intrusive thought that's like \"one day you're going to go completely crazy, nothing or no one will be able to help you or calm you down, and you'll live in agony and embarrassment\". I know it's pretty irrational, but that *terrifies* me.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced this? If so, what helped you?",

You're not going to suddenly go crazy. \n\nTry to take it easy on yourself and do small relaxing things you love to do. If you haven't already, it may help to speak to a doctor to make sure nothing more serious is going on. They can also help you find the right resources you need. \n\nFor me, a mix of hot showers, hot decaf tea or coffee, good books, light walks, easy going cycling sessions, and big hugs from my wife can turn things around."

I just registered today so I expect them to take a few days to process my info, and get back to me next week.)\n\nWill I get in trouble with the insurance company if I call them and say that? Will they be like \"oh, why didnt you share that info when initially signing up?\" Or will they be like \"hey buddy, no problem, let me fix that for ya\"? I am worried I'll face negative consequences/repercussions and that I'll get in trouble.\n\nI might be overthinking this and maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but I wanted to ask.

We don't live together; we're both college students living with our parents. But whenever we get to see each other I try to talk about light topics and provide her with warmth, water, food, attention (or space if required), etc. I've asked her if anything specifically helps the anxiety settle, whether it's an activity like watching TV, playing games, doing puzzles - or if it's a mindset like not worrying about assignments being due or accomplishing a task. But she says that nothing helps whatsoever.\nI understand anxiety is different for everyone, but does anyone have suggestions as to what I can say/do to provide comfort? What are some things that help yall out? What helps calm an anxiety attack? I only have a vague understanding of what anxiety is like, but not anywhere near what she's going through.\nAny input is greatly appreciated!\n\nTLDR: I need ideas on what I can do for my girlfriend to help her with her anxiety",

        "text": "I have been really struggling for the past 9 months with anxiety and my relationship with food. \n\nIt was Valentine‚Äôs Day and my partner and I went out for a meal - lovely pizza place with a decent view. Was very chilled. I got a pizza with olives and anchovies. Towards the end of the meal I was met with a sudden blockade where it felt like a threw my head, grabbed onto the table and couldn‚Äôt swallow. I pretty much ran out of the building and had a mini panic attack. The remainder of the evening, I just constantly swallowed saliva until it felt as though I‚Äôd licked the Sahara desert. It became obsessive and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. \n\nOver the following week, eating food became extremely difficult. I was stressed and annoyed about the whole situation. 4 days after this incident I suffered my first massive panic attack. As you know if you‚Äôve had a panic attack before, I felt as though I was about to die. This went on for hours and didn‚Äôt subside until I drove myself home, closed the curtains and jumped into bed. \n\nFor weeks after my panic attack, I got back on some Sertraline I‚Äôd found in the cupboard in hopes this would get me back on track, forgetting the horrendous side effects I‚Äôm faced with when starting. I‚Äôd previously taken this medication for depression after my first son was born after quite a traumatic birth. This time it was different and I was hypersensitive to the medication. Heightened anxiety, no appetite, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhoea and pressure in my head constantly. \n\nI have done everything I should have since then. Seeing a therapist specialised in CBT. I go to the gym. Started my antidepressants and have tried exposure therapy with my eating. \n\nThe majority of my anxiety, as mentioned by my therapist, was a build up from last Christmas. My son was unwell for weeks with no answers as to why. I was due to be sedated and have my wisdom teeth removed in the new year. They cancelled the appointment three times, twice last minute! General stress of Christmas and trying to please every family member and their dog. The financial stress that Christmas brings and general stress from my workplace where I‚Äôm a director of the company and have a lot of responsibilities. \n\n10 days ago I upped my sertraline dosage from 50mg to 75mg because I still feel in a similar place to where I was 9 months ago. I have to drive for half an hour to and from work. This can be a real trigger for me and is really quite frustrating because I used to love driving. I get stressed and constantly swallow my saliva when my anxiety rises throughout the journey. The anxiety is crippling and has left me a shell of my old self. \n\nA few questions for those who have got this far having read through my terribly written short story. (I got a D in English, forgive me) I‚Äôm a 34 year old male with a great support system around me. I have all reasons in life to be happy - but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to choke every time I swallow food or saliva. Then I‚Äôll die and never see my family again. And with Christmas fast approaching, the nights closing in and the weather being miserable, I feel lost.\n\n*Has anyone had the swallowing issue with heightened anxiety? \n*How long would it usually take for the initial side effects to wear off after increasing my sertraline? \n*Should I just keep doing as I am in hope to eventually feel better or take action now and potentially change my antidepressant and do some light therapy with my therapist?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated if you‚Äôve been in my shoes or a situation similar. Thank you. ",

Don‚Äôt let others influence your driving ‚Äúemergency vehicles not included‚Äù. Don‚Äôt let others speed you up or slow you down. Drive how you feel comfortable.

        "text": "I am seeking help from the community. Doctors seem to either not know what to diagnose him with, or say different theories. Therapists have said that they are unable to continue progressive work with him. We don't know what to do next and are scared of doing the wrong things.\n\nI am the older brother (26) writing about my younger brother (19). Before I set up the story and get into the details, I want to prioritize some observations about him to keep in mind when reading the post. I am not a doctor nor is my mom.\n\nMy younger¬† brother was always zoning out in times growing up. He did have friends as a child but struggled to participate in things that require human interaction and people skills. He was signed up for so many activities and did not object to any. Today we find him spending his time staring at walls. To give you an idea, he can stay in bed the entire day and do nothing. I mean nothing. He can be on a 14 hour flight and stare in his seat and do nothing, not even use the bathroom. Staring in front of him with no tv, no game, no book. We try to offer him a movie to watch or something to do but he chooses not to. No interest in movies, music, exercise, nothing. He can go hours even days without eating unless my mother makes him food and asks him to eat. He has virtually no interest and no hobbies and hasn't had a friend for 5 years. He pulls his phone out in social situations just to scroll left and right on his homepage. He doesn't actually do anything on it. We think it's to reduce some form of anxiety when in public or with people in general. He is silent in conversation and doesn't talk unless being talked to, even then he replies with. Maybe, sometimes, yes, no, kinda and essentially one word answers. He is slow at processing and moving from one activity to the other. To get him out of the house can take hours, to get him out of the car can also be hours. He lives in an extreme denial of his life that he is okay and can do well in all situations, while on the other hand he seems that he is extremely hard on himself. It almost seems like he has to put on a strong front with a lot of pride in order to cope with the lack of ability to obtain a job, do well in school, and socialize. He blacks out at times of high anxiety and stress. He doesn't remember hitting me or calling my mom names. (more of this portion later)\n\nMy little brother lives with my mom and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is extremely nice and sweet and will never get in between them or try and raise my younger brother. My mother loves him extremely and can suffocate him at times with being at his every need. I can't blame her given that if she doesn't cook every meal then he simply won't eat. My little brother does not do what he is told, it almost seems that he is not capable at simple tasks. Like his mind is his own prison that restricts him from doing anything that he wants to do. He always says he will do something and ends up not. Examples are when he is asked to go outside for 30 min he says he will later and on his own time but finds himself in his bed instead. My mother does everything to get him out of bed, she works minimal hours so she can be present and revolves her life around him. She can do this due to having money saved up. He has had some small wins like getting a drivers license, starting school at a community college and spending time with a group of friends for an hour a week at an organized event. He does great at his math classes but fails his english classes. He lies about going to the guidance counselor and talking about classes next term as he is lost and doesn't know how to navigate college yet wont ask for help. It took me an entire day of pulling teeth to get him to show me his English grade that he said he was receiving a good grade and ended up not submitting the past 15 assignments and having a 47%. Interesting thing is he submitted the first 15 or so assignments and was receiving good grades, then he stopped all of a sudden. It seems that he lacks motivation in life for practically anything. It seems that he is paralyzed by his anxiety to do anything. Yet when I ask him questions about situations that he froze in, he wants to be left alone and laughs at it and lies that it was for a made up reason. I asked him if he felt nervous, or if his heart rate went up, or why he changed his mind. He seems to be disconnected from his emotions completely.\n\nMy part. I have an opposite approach than my mother. My father has not been much a part of his life from year 14 to present day. My father set boundaries and limitations while my mother struggled to. When I talk to my mom I try to explain to her that she must set boundaries, otherwise he will never achieve any independence or happiness. He will continue to stay put in his comfortable situation, rather than take chances and risks to expand his life. I tell him that he must show his mother his grades at school, that he needs to go outside at times. I am scared this feeds into his low self esteem and ends up hurting him more, but I don't know what to do otherwise. I want to recognize he has something but we don't know what it is. We have had professionals say he is not depressed or anxious while others said he is both. We have had professionals say he has a form of autism, while others say he does not. I try to get my mother to force a healthy routine in his life of what he is capable of, with consequences. Thing is we can't give him any since he has nothing in his life he values that we could take from him. He is 19 but I can't get my mother to give him the consequence of sleeping outside. She doesn't have it in her. I do but I know that if I force this when I am around and my mother doesn't then it won't solve anything. Rather it would do more harm than good. I dont stay with my mothers long enough to instill positive behavior and routine.\n\nWhen I push him. When I push him too hard he can blow up. This has only happened a few times. Ex: I came to visit during the summer and we drove two hours to a specific hike on 100 degree day. He wanted to stay in the car and I was not having it. He ended up blowing up and hitting me while he was screaming ‚Äòjust hit me already‚Äô yet I have never hit him in my adult life. As kids we played rough at times but even then I would take his hits and rarely hit him back or retaliate. During these times of stress his entire body goes berserk. He slams doors, sprints away, breathes heavily, screams at the top of his lungs and his face goes to anger. He blacks out and doesn't remember any of these events.¬†\n\nLies and argumentative. Pretty self explanatory. Even when caught red handed he denies it with all his ability. It almost seems like he views as the world against him. He plays on my moms emotions to get what he wants. He makes her feel bad for him so he can be left alone and not do the things he say he will do that would be good for him.\n\nI had a talk with him about exposure therapy. Since he couldnt get the courage to walk up and ask for a job, I ask him to go buy a coffee for me so he talks with the person at the counter. He laughs and says that he can do it and that its easy. Yet I try to reason with him saying that when we went to costco so he could ask for a job he didnt pull through with it. Thats why we need to start small. He seemed to tense up and ask me questions like what exactly should I say. I tell him to order a small black coffee, as a way to keep it simple. He asks me if the lady will ask him any more questions afterwords. I told him she might ask if he wants sugar and to say no to that question. We needed to go over this a few times in order to prep him. He ended up completing this and I praised him for it. Yet when i praised him for it he shrugged it off like it was nothing and it was a joke. That he easily could have done it. I give him genuin compliments at times and he turns it around like im making fun of him, when I give him pointers to be successful he takes it as criticism instead.\n\nDoesnt open up. Not to my mom, me or any therapist he has ever talked to. Which is why therapists stop working with him since they cant make progress.\n\nA bit more about him and his life. My family moved around a lot. Including myself but him most since he was 7 years younger than me. Always new environment, new friends, new cultures. When he was younger he was laughing and joking and playful. He played piano and was really good at it. He played sports growing up including water polo and soccer. He spent time with friends and me and him have always had a close relationship. When I left the house at 18 and he was 11 things seemed fine. I went through drug addiction and got clean at 22. My sister had her tantrums growing up and left at 17. My father and mother split when i was 22 and he was 15. I didnt notice any of the bad blood between them, but it started to escalate a year or so after I left the house around the time I was most deep into my addiction. During this time I believe my little brother was neglected. I spent years raising him as a teenager since my father spent his time traveling for work. He was essentially left alone all of a sudden, with parents who fought regularly and no one to turn to. Given his character we also think he may have been bullied at school. We never found out through him. Around this time is when he closed up.¬†\n\nMedication: recently he started taking an ssri. Otherwise nothing.",

        "text": "I've suffered with anxiety my whole life. I'm unmedicated. \n\n6 years ago I dealt with a mysterious infection in my bladder and cervix that causes me 5 months of severe trauma from the medical system dismissing me as crazy. I ended up finding out about Ureaplasma/mycoplasma...despite testing negative I did the antibiotic treatment on my own and was cured. Got my life back, then didn't have sex for 5 years.\n\nThen I met someone and I thought I met my soul mate. Long story short he was a covert narcissist and we broke up after 8 months. Soon after the breakup those familiar symptoms came back. My doctor tested me for Ureaplasma right away and I was positive. She got me 14 days doxy and I took it. My symptoms went away fairly fast. I was in the middle of moving and missed a dose here and there but still took them all in the end. \n\nAll was well for a month, when all of a sudden symptoms returned. I immediately tested again for Ureaplasma/mycoplasma and was negative. Treated for yeast infection but it didn't relief symptoms. Retested again over a week later and still negative. Symptoms were raging at this point with vaginal burning, urethra and bladder burning, burning after urination. All my classic symptoms. I asked for clindamycin cream out of desperation which stopped the vaginal burning but not the urethra/bladder symptoms. I've done swabs, urine cultures, all negative. Went to the ER and was humiliated. Doctors think I'm crazy. I even ordered micro biom tests out of pocket and all negative.\n\nAt this point I've spiraled into a deep depression. Reliving the same  traumatic nightmare I dealt with 6 years ago. Symptoms got so bad I redid Ureaplasma treatment on my own. I'm still on it. Burning urethra and bladder symptoms have stopped but I still get some burning after urination vaginally. By anxiety lasts all day, and I've been stuck in tense flight/fight for weeks. Now my pelvis feels full and I can't hold much urine. I have to literally push it out. I have an appt with a specialist in January, and a pelvic floor therapist next week.  Until then I'm trying to convince myself that I'm going to be okay but I can't. \nI can't work. All I do is lay in bed a cry, and pee all day.  I am a single parent and can't even function to care for my son, he's spending the holiday week with my mom so I can try to get myself sorted mentally. \nI'm starting to think I'll never get better and I'm terrified. \n\nCould my anxiety and trauma from the past have sent me into a vicious pain and anxiety cycle? Obviously I'm curing some sort of infection as certain parts of the burning are now gone. \n\nHas anyone gone through anything similar? ",

        "text": " I'm a teen, but suffer from anxiety throughout my whole life. From very young age, I remember myself very shy in new companies, even nervous. I didn't have much friends in my neighborhood or school. I preferred playing videogames, but even there, I was scared of any communication.\n\n I'm not sure why I had such trouble, but I still have this problem. I have hobbies, things I'd like to make, but if I'm making something wrong - I won't ever try again. Because as soon as I'm letting my mind flow, my head fills with anxious thoughts that make me cry. Anxiety makes me feels useless and helpless.\n\n I spend all of my time on phone or listen to someone. Just something to shut my mind. It's the only way I can feel relaxed and feel myself a regular person. Because of this, I'm addicted to gadgets. The other ways to rely stress is fidgeting or bad habits like biting my nails. \n \n Sometimes I don't do my homework because of spending all the time in my phone. But the thing that pulls me out is worries about my future:\n A year ago I was in new country, new school, and I didn't knew language because of circumstances. Of course I didn't have any friends. I thought all the bad things was because the school was bad. But now I'm going to gymnasium, more influential. And only now I started to understand that the problem was anxiety.\n\n I do wanna upswing my state, have a good future, but I have a bad start. My grades are average and it pisses me off. In this country we also have hours, that we have to get by socialising and helping. In one day it'll be the last month before the 1st semester and I'm concerned about how I'll gain hours and fix my grades.\n \nI'd like to tell my parents about this, but because of anxiety I can't say a single word about how I feel. So I'm writing this post, as my friend recommended, to get some advice from people that can be familiar with situation like this.",

        "text": "TW: Suicide/ideation\n\nUrgent help needed for long distance partner w/ painful anxiety attacks \n\nNeed urgent help for my partner. We‚Äôre long distance (both in medical school, but she‚Äôs outside the US). She has doctors appts set up for when her semester ends and she‚Äôs back in the US for breaks (~3 weeks) but I need help helping her until then. \n\nBoth of us are autistic. I‚Äôve had a panic disorder for over a decade, she‚Äôs had depression for about as long. I like to think I‚Äôve built up a good repertoire of coping mechanisms for panic attacks, but these past few days have been out of my depth. \n\nIt seems like a combination of severe stress and autistic meltdown. She‚Äôs severely sleep deprived bc her anxiety won‚Äôt let her sleep until she passes out tense every night and only manages 3-4hrs of sleep. Her muscles and joints burn constantly from the tension and last night she said every inch of her skin felt like it was burning, she said it was agonizing. Usually me calling and her hearing my voice helps, but she‚Äôs so overstimulated she won‚Äôt let me call. She has a friend that looks after her and makes sure she eats at school, but once she‚Äôs home alone it‚Äôs terrifying. She will be physically paralyzed for hours and in sm pain from the anxiety. \n\nWe‚Äôve tried breathing techniques, distraction, me calling and rambling w/o her having to respond back, somatic input (arm squeezes, vagus nerve stimulation with heating pad), showers (make things WAY worse), talking things out, attempting to reframe thinking. \n\nWe can sometimes get an hour or so of reprieve where we can talk normally. We play a writing game together and sometimes can get an exchange or two through that which is my sign she‚Äôs doing okay. But she‚Äôs been in so much pain for days now. \n\nTW: suicide/ideation\nShe has a plan. Won‚Äôt let me know what it is. She texted me the other day trying to get me to tell her what personal items of hers I want if she does do it. She‚Äôs promised me she‚Äôll always call if she‚Äôs close and I‚Äôve been able to help her before, but I‚Äôm running out of things to say other than ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in pain, I‚Äôm right here,‚Äù (she doesn‚Äôt like when I say I‚Äôm sorry). I used to feel confident it was just her depression talking, and she‚Äôd always reassure me that she didn‚Äôt actually see it as an option, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true anymore. I‚Äôm really worried if I don‚Äôt find a way to help her with the physical pain she‚Äôs in something bad will happen. \n\nHer family life is rough. I‚Äôm not sure if I should tell her mother or not‚Äî she‚Äôs honestly a terrifying woman and told my partner if she fails a class/drops out of school, she‚Äôs not welcome back home. But every once in a while she‚Äôll help with mental health stuff (made my partner the doc appt for when she gets back). Medical care where she is is incredibly minimal and she has past medical trauma that makes encouraging her to go to hospital extremely difficult. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt go to her‚Äî I don‚Äôt have my passport (in the process of getting it, but I‚Äôm also in med school). I can say with full confidence my partner is the love of my life. Not being able to be there and hold her and help her calm down is agonizing. I need help helping her, please. ",

I also worry about my stepkids and any potential issues that may arise in the future between my partner and his ex. I catastrophize the littlest things. I almost make up scenarios that haven't happened, and have no idea why or how to stop it. I think my therapist and I are still in the unpackimg phase, as I haven't really gotten advice yet. I just want everything to stop and for my mind and thoughts to quiet down. I never used to be like this, and I'm sure my perimenopause is just exacerbating things. My partner is loving and supportive, but really doesn't understand. He thinks it's just a switch I shoukd be able to turn off. I wish it was that easy. Does anyone else feel this way? I feel so alone and helpless and broken, and like I'll feel this way until I die. ",

I‚Äôm ok with basic transactions but when customers need other things I still have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. It's a very busy big store at the mall so I‚Äôm dreading how tomorrow will go. I am doing ok but have made a few mistakes which is embarrassing. I got flustered and just wanted to run off and cry. \n\nAny advice or kind words are appreciated. Thank you so so much!!!! ",

You may experience a constant flow of people and you may get tired, but hopefully your coworkers are nice! We used to joke around that we were heading into battle and we‚Äôd find way to have fun during the chaos of it all.\n\nI think at this point before your shift or even during, just talk to someone about how you‚Äôre feeling a little nervous and it would be great if you could lean on them whenever you have a question or something comes up that you don‚Äôt quite know how to handle. Remember, you‚Äôre very new and your managers/supervisors should be there to support and help you.\n\nAll in all, you‚Äôll do great and you‚Äôll end up having some fun! Here if you ever wanna chat!"

The coming days will still be busy but my advice is SLOW DOWN a bit and take your time. its easy to let the chaotic energy and people trying to rush you take over, and thats when mistakes happen. dont be afraid to take a breath and just pause for a sec to think about what you need to do. Better to take a few extra seconds and do it right! \n\nDont be afraid to step away and go to the bathroom or something if you need a moment of peace. obviously dont spend like 10 minutes in the bathroom for no reason, but its okay to lie and say you need to go to the bathroom and just take a few minutes to breathe and recenter yourself in a quiet space.\n\n   \nAlso just remember its neverrrr that serious. Even being new, im sure your best judgement and common sense will stop you from making any BAD mistakes - everything else can be fixed, or is a learning opportunity. and at the end of the day, anything that can be bought at a mall is not that important and people can wait - they are choosing to shop at the busiest time of year, they will need to learn to be patient!"

I work out 5-6 times a week and have never had any pre-existing heart/asthma conditions. I do struggle though with health anxiety due to loss in my family however which causes me to sometimes go into panic. After one of my long runs (8miles in 150ft elevation) I felt some chest tightness and shortness of breath. Not during the run, but afterwards when I am just relaxing and resting. It felt as if I had to actively try to get deep breaths of air in to feel normal. I knew something felt weird so I began to research online which fed into a panic attack at night. I was able to sleep it off and go to urgent care the following morning. They ran an EKG and ruled out a heart attack, but they did say I have a sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia. Doctor said he thinks its due to stress/anxiety but legally he had to tell me to see a cardiologist because there is an arrhythmia. I'm waiting for the appointment in 5 days. I'm noticing that my chest tightness/shortnesss of breath doesn't seem to be getting better even with sleep and no running. I've completely stopped running and have just been doing light weight lifting, but I've been waking up with a similar sensation of chest tightness like i'm wearing a rubber band around my ribcage area. I also have been falling into deep sleep past 11am when normally I am up around 8:30-9am. I'm curious if anyone has had a similar experience and if they have any insight on what this might be.\n\nThanks in advance",

I went to the doctor and hospital multiple times and everything checked out alright but I still felt like I was being gaslight. I've tried to take a more positive approach to this and agreeing with my doctor's that it's most likely caused by anxiety and stress, but then again once I started to calm down I'm having weird visual syndromes. I saw small bright fireflies in my vision for a few seconds and went down another nervous breakdown. I obsessively googled every symptom I had and after that I'm noticing that when I look away from a light in a dark room the light streaks and follows my vision for a split second, I now notice my floaters more, I still have shortness of breath, and I think I see spots in my vision at times. all of this is to say that I'm not sure if I'm actually experiencing physical health issues or mental health issues. if anyone has been through this and has managed to get past it i would greatly appreciate any help in trying to overcome this. thank you for reading this and I hope you all have a great day üôè.",

        "text": "I want to know if anyone relates to me. I want to try watching new shows or rewatch old ones I thought I liked but I seem to have a very strong aversion to watching shows that I know have stressful moments. I want to rewatch Arcane season 1 but all I can remember are the stressful scenes and it makes me just not want to watch it. I want to watch Breaking Bad but I was stressed in the first episode. I only watch shows that I know for sure do not stress me out. Am I autistic? Is this an anxiety thing? I also have ADHD. I feel like my behavior has gotten to a point of being stressed out that i‚Äôm stressed about watching tv shows. I was also thinking it could be phone addiction to short form media because I didn‚Äôt really have this issue when I was younger. ",

        "text": "My psychiatrists told me I had GAD, and they said my mother is the root cause for all of that. Recently, I got admitted to ER after my left arm got mauled by a pitbull. My mum was concerned and have shown more efforts to contact me almost every day, even asking about my wellbeing, if I've eaten or not, if my arm was hurting. Mind you, we fought a lot, and when we fought, she didn't even attempt to reach out to me, and immediately cut her financial support.\n\nI had this desire to continue my education before all this tragedy happened, I let my mother know that. She said she will support me. Then she sent me money. Then we fought again, and she stopped sending me money. I was frustrated. Why does she keep doing this? I need to pay my school. So like any sensible adult, I looked for a job. I find a part-time job at a warehouse, where the pay is fine. The catch is, it's a labour job of course, and the shift ends at midnight. That was when I was surrounded by around 7 dogs when I walked back from work, and how I ended up in the ER.\n\nMy therapist told me I should find a support system other than her. Well, she's never my support system in the first place. My grandparents, the people who raised me, especially my grandmother, had always had my back. Now they're gone, and I was left with my *ughh* mum who insists she will always be there for me, when she's not. Recently, I think I said something that hurt her feelings. I told her I want a picture of my cat. Her side of family took care of my cat after I moved out to the city. I don't know why she sounded upset, when I asked abouty cat. She said I should visit them, her family. \n\nFirst of all, I'm not close to any of her family. They are like this loud close knit clan (with many dramas and chaos), and I had bad memories dealing with her family. Plus, most of them stayed in this one small house, with my ex-convict uncle was there, and so was my ill aunt who had schizophrenia. Second, her family didn't even visit me when I was in the hospital, except one of my uncle, who lived separately from them. My mother made excuses they were busy. I insisted I want a picture of my cat, but my mum told me her family was busy. And after that, she didn't even reach out to me again. I honestly don't understand what happened. I just want a picture of my cat, or is it the fact she knows I don't want to see her family? I don't know, I'm tired of my mum playing these games.\n\nI used to work as a sales, then after I signed to volunteer at my country's service army (it's not regular army), I was forced to resign because the company I worked at couldn't give me 1 month leave for my training, even unpaid, for just 1 month. It's not regular army training, it's up to me if I want to attend their occasional training, but to be part of this voluntary service army, I need to attend one month of basic compulsory training. Still, my company won't give me 1 month leave. I understand that. That's how I ended up jobless after the training. \n\nAs for my mum, I barely see her. Maybe once every 3-5 years. She worked overseas. She was quite wealthy, but barely gave any child support when I was a kid. Now, I'm adult, she said it's not her responsibility. I get that. I'm an adult. Maybe she needs to feed her 5 grown ass siblings and their kids, who knows. Because I kept seeing my uncles got some money from her. And I've heard she send some money to my cousin who's studying. But every now and then, even after I was jobless, she always promises she will be there for me, she will support me. But the moment we clash again, she sends me a lengthy message reminding me my life sucks, stops her resources, and maybe bitch to her family she had this terrible daughter.\n\nI'm tired from all of these. I am recovering, I just need someone to be there for me. I had no friends I could rely on. I feel like I want to cry, but I can't. I should have listen to my therapist that I shouldn't rely on my mother, find some support group. Honestly, that's why I'm excited to go back to school, but I'm also afraid my GAD or because of my damn mother makes me hard to connect to any of my coursemates. I'm really terrified of my future.\n\n\n\nEdit:  The institution I enrolled in had government subsidised most of the fees, and I'll be receiving allowances for my studies. If my mother knows about this, she's more than happy to not send me any money. The institution I enrolled in stated in the agreement that students are not allowed to work, and parents still need to give some allowances to students. ",

        "text": "I‚Äôm in my early 40s and I‚Äôve had a life long anxiety associated with presenting in front of groups at work. It‚Äôs something that held me back professionally for a long period of my early life, until about 5 years ago when I just decided that I couldn‚Äôt afford to let it throttle me anymore.\n\nI‚Äôm now in a senior role in Tech and have to face my fear fairly regularly. The typical scenario would be a meeting of about 20-30 people, where I have to present a section. \n\nAbout a week before these meetings the real stress starts, and I start losing sleep. Thanks to lots of prep and practically memorising every word, during the presentations, I always do ok. As soon as I‚Äôm into my flow my anxiety mostly disappears and dare I say it, I sometimes start enjoying it. \n\nBut the anxiety when I‚Äôm sat around the table waiting for my turn to present is so intense, physically uncomfortable and scary (I still get the ‚Äúshall I just run away?‚Äù thoughts).  I do all the usual breathing exercises, try and clear my mind, etc, but haven‚Äôt really found anything that consistently works. \n\nThe specific part that I‚Äôd like to get under control is the first 30 seconds. When it‚Äôs my turn to present I often get a huge dump of adrenaline and my heart rate and breathing just shoots up (despite having basically been meditating at the table beforehand!).  I then spend the first minute of the presentation trying to get my breathing under control whilst trying to talk and it‚Äôs just really difficult. \n\nI get myself under control eventually and then I deliver a good presentation. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to go through this every time. It‚Äôs upsetting, stressful and just doesn‚Äôt feel good for my health! I was hoping that if I just carried on doing these things it would improve but it‚Äôs not got any better and is the main source of anxiety in my life. Because i can‚Äôt avoid this in my job, it basically means i now have a constant low level of anxiety. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice for things I can do to try and make that first 30 seconds easier, and try and avoid the adrenaline/mega heart rate/accelerated breathing thing? \n\nIdeally I‚Äôd like to try and get a grip on this without having to speak to my Doctor and get medication. But I‚Äôm at a point where I probably need to try anything and everything. \n\nThanks so much to anybody that read this far! ",

        "text": "I haven't checked to see if this is medically accurate, but this is what this feels like. I have food poisoning right now. It hit me all of a sudden with a familiar feeling. It feels like all the blood has rushed out of my head and into my gut in order to deal with the problem. It feels like this shuts down the logical and feel good parts of my brain. I get unnaturally tired. Like extreme fatigue all of a sudden that feels like I am going to pass out. Like my head is about to hit the floor at any moment. I mean, it kinda makes sense biologically. Your body needs to fight the intruders instead of give your brain a bunch of feel good attention, in an effort to survive.\n\nUnfortunately this triggers a panic attack for me every time. It sucks! I haven't had a panic attack in a LONG time.\n\nAfter the 14th trip to the bathroom I asked a family member if they got sick off the food we ate and they pretty much confirmed it. What is important about all this, though, is that I used this theory to solve a long term food allergy I had. I have been allergic to wheat or gluten for at least 10 years. This caused me to have extreme anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic attacks...I believe. It also caused me to stop driving for 5 years. It was simply a case of just being in intense gastrointestinal distress ALL THE TIME. Just recently I have been able to drive around town like a normal human being because I cut wheat out of my diet about a year ago and slowly used exposure therapy to get back into leaving the house and driving around like a normal person. It is so amazing that I have been able to pinpoint that problem and make progress. What is weird is I was tested every way possible for those medical problems and they said I didn't have them! Very frustrating.\n\nPlease don't give up on your journey. It is always possible to improve. I wish I had some more positive words right now, but I think I need to hit the bathroom again, lol.\n\nSorry if this is a trigger for anyone or breaks any of the other rules, I see them all on the right side as I write this and I usually never post because I am afraid of breaking group rules.",

Hear me out, if you just sit with the thoughts rather than fighting them and just let yourself be okay with the chest pain, that‚Äôs how it will go away. The more you fixate on the feeling and thoughts and try to do everything to stop them, the more they happen!\n\nIf someone tells you to NOT think about something, the first thing everyone does is think about it. It‚Äôs intrusive, you can‚Äôt stop it.

A hospital visit  once a week. Seriously. I have a $100 co-pay for emergency visits with my insurance, and now i owe upwards of $2,500. But yeah, like i said, panic attacks. They subdued recently. But now im collapsing due to CONSTANT anxiety. So bad ive had suicidal thoughts. I get about 2 hours of sleep a night. No joke. Ill go a week sleeping like that till my body and mind cant keep up and i crash, and sleep for 16 hours straight. The bags under my eyes are dark, its a chore to laugh or smile, i am genuinely being effected by this. \n\nNot to mention, i have a son on the way. Me and my GF of 3 years are expecting in less than 2 months now. Our relationship is very good. But my mental health is affecting everything around me. Bills, work, relationships, sleep, happiness, you name it. I want to be better for my family. \n\nIll end this by saying what i have tried. Meds, doctors visits, sleep aids, meditation, positive self talk, vitamins, supplements, massages. \n\nWTF DO I DO. I visibly just LOOK sick. End rant.",

It's anxiety, they'll give you anxiety meds or an IV and charge you a buttload of money.\n\nWhat you need to do is meet with a psychiatrist and get on anxiety meds. You can get benzodiazapines for a rescue medication for the panic attacks (they kick in very quickly and are out of your system in 3 or so hours) in addition to something daily. This will both lower your anxiety and increase your tolerance for dealing with anxiety. If your anxiety is a 9/10 right now, meds alone can drop you to 6/10 easy.\n\nPanic attacks are simply high anxiety plus adrenaline. Adrenaline is a huge boost of energy and when it gets directed 100% at anxiety, you spiral. Panic attacks alone cause a feedback loop. They suck so much you fear having another one, that fear builds anxiety until it reaches the maximum and you have a panic attack. Panic attacks causing panic attacks aka panic disorder. You essentially need to break the chain in some manner. \n\nMaybe you've done all this, whatever, keep doing it. Meds are trial and error. Sometimes you take a pill for 2 weeks and you find out you feel the same or worse. You waltz back into the appointment and ask for an adjustment. You try that out. Rinse and repeat. It's just the easiest and most effective way to lower anxiety. Therapy is the other route."

                "body": "Yea what Antionio said, it‚Äôs hard to tell by your description. I can only speak from my experience but one vague way i like to think about it is that anxiety is when you‚Äôre nervous about something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet and depression is about the past. Anxiety can work in clear way like when you are overly nervous for a presentation and you get the feeling leading up to it. It can also be something from your subconscious. For example, that bad thing that happened might still be affecting your thought and it is making you feel the way you do because your body doesn‚Äôt know if the threat is still there. I‚Äôve gotten anxiety for random things but i mostly feel it when i have something in mind, like gathering with family for thanksgiving today. However, you could also have quite a few things that are altogether making you feel this way. The symptoms you are saying happen with anxiety and could be honestly happening for the same reason you are writing this post. You are anxious about your health right now and are constantly checking your heart rate which is stressing you out even more. I‚Äôve been in your position before with writing reddit posts for things like this and the best thing would honestly be to go to a doctor just to settle your nerves. 99% of the time they‚Äôll tell you your feeling anxiety, and probably over 50% of patients get check ups for things that are mentally affecting them more than physical. At the same time you can tell that a fast heart rate isn‚Äôt normal when you‚Äôre sleeping so maybe something is going on. I‚Äôm not saying that to try and scare you but you honestly won‚Äôt know what wrong with you unless you go to the doctor. If there isn‚Äôt anything they see, then it‚Äôll most likely go away because you will feel safe knowing a doctor couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with you. \n\nAlso if it is anxiety it won‚Äôt be something that‚Äôll go away forever. When first experiencing anxiety a lot of people try to fight it and find a cure but the only way to help yourself is to accept you have it and that you will still be able to get through everything the same way you already have. Sorry for the long reply but i‚Äôve been in your position before and want you to know what has worked for me."

Lights at night also seem a bit fuzzy (kinda like astigmatism but not as bad, just like, spikey if that makes sense) and I can now also see rainbow hues around lights at night. No other symptoms though. I've also used eye drops for dry eyes, but it hasn't changed anything.\n\nI've never had vision problems before. I've thought about the fact that I maybe need glasses, mostly bc I do a lot of school work on my computer/phone and I use social media, but I try my best to keep my screentime on my phone under 2 hours. But since I'm still pretty young, I don't really know what to think, especially because it was not really a gradual thing - I noticed it all of a sudden.\n\nSo it this like, a normal/expected thing when dealing with anxiety?\nThanks im advance :)\n",

I cry suddenly, I had dinner and for some unknown reason litteraly started sobbing as I ate which is so embarrassing, I'm constantly shaking, my rbpm has gone from 69bpm to 90bpm, I can't sleep at night, my food litteraly goes cold because the sense of doom is making it so difficult to eat I feel constantly on edge im really struggling.  I've spoken to my mother, she doesn't believe in putting young people on meds. It's unbearable.\n\nEdit: when I said worser than greif, I meant the physical symptoms not the emotional.",

I also just have a terrible time trying to swallow pills but the part that I have the biggest issue is the mental side of things, the doctor did say just to take Mt time and try.\n\nI'm getting worried at taking my first pill I just cant bring myself to doing it, I want to cry I'm so overwhelmed.

        "text": "So, I‚Äôve started a new job recently (nearing month 3) and it has been without a doubt the toughest job I‚Äôve ever done.\n\nWhen I initially applied with this company, it was for a different role, a role that I was comfortable with as I had just spent 4 years working in this field, but as I have a background in journalism, the company offered me another position. While it was very daunting, I decided to go with it as the team was very supportive and welcoming.\n\nIn October, apparently it was the busiest month my department had ever had and I was stuck in the middle of it all, being trained while dealing with the pressure of getting everything done. I feel like a lot of my training was strained here as I had to learn in a high pressure situation.\n\nWhen I first started, my direct manager was very friendly with me, she would tell me I was doing amazing for little things, and she‚Äôd even call me ‚Äògirly‚Äô and ask me to go for lunch with her. However this month of November she‚Äôs flipped entirely on me. She‚Äôs stopped being nice and I swear she‚Äôs been having secret chats with other coworkers to have lunch with them and not invite me.\n\nAlbeit, I‚Äôve had a fair share of mistakes. But I‚Äôm learning and as I‚Äôve said this job is very, very hard. There are so many strict processes to follow, so many things to remember that it almost feels impossible. As this job is hybrid as well, it makes it kind of hard to learn. My manager will come in maybe once a week and the one time I had asked her if I could sit with her for a little to ask all of my burning questions, she was in such a rush and dealing with other meetings that I felt like I was inconveniencing her.\n\nI obviously struggle a lot with anxiety, my whole life. In the last two years it‚Äôs gotten worse, though. To the point that I had to take a 7 month leave from my previous job as I wasn‚Äôt able to manage my anxieties and panic attacks anymore. I‚Äôve improved so much since then but I‚Äôm so worried the stress of this new job is going to put me back in that dark place.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm obviously so scared to get fired right now. I feel like anything I say or do, my manager is quick to give me criticism and it‚Äôs affecting my confidence and morale severely. I‚Äôm not saying I need a pat on the back for every little thing I do but to be always criticized for my little mistakes and never at least acknowledged for everything else I handle correctly is affecting me. I‚Äôm trying to keep in mind that I‚Äôve only been at this job for less than 3 months but they‚Äôre making me feel like I‚Äôm an idiot for not understanding all of this right away.\n\nSigh, thank you for listening.",

I posted about the reason for the break up, and discussed them (namely their religion) in a dating subreddit, but didn't include any identifiable personal info like about their work, name, city, etc. Overtime, I started moving on and posted in other subreddits (like the one for my city, dating experiences/advice, travel, sports team, the general industry I'm in without mentioning my job title, etc.)\n\nA few weeks ago, I ran across their reddit account (it was their real name and they had posted about their niche job. I'm 100% sure it's theirs), and saw that they had been online for a while (the little green dot was showing). When we were together, we had talked about some reddit pages a little bit, (like one does when talking about Facebook and Twitter pages), but I never mentioned my account name. \n\nAfter seeing they were online, I became concerned about them possibly finding my account, and deleted the messages where I had talked about the breakup, but I'm worried that they might have found my account and read through the messages before I deleted and put two and two together. I didn't bash them, so I don't think there was anything that could be considered libel if they went so far as to show other people or take screenshots. \nI went through my contacts and it looks like they have blocked me, but I'm not sure when. \n\nThe logical side of me is saying it was just a coincidence and that I am way overthinking this, but the anxious side has flared up and I'm embarassed for even posting in the first place and I'm worried they put two and two together. \n\nI appreciate any advice.

Yes I've tried to ignore the judges and focus on my music, but my hands were still shaking like crazy that my bow couldn't stay still. And yes I've tried to practice breathing exercises, and yet I'd still hear my heart pounding and would still end up zoning out mid performance, so if you could help me out I'd be forever grateful \n\nAlso sorry for how long this is so ty if you've read it all I really appreciate it!",

        "text": "In my journey to overcome cardiophobia, it was a fine line  between admitting I was anxious  and then turning around and telling myself so what? Oh but you were gaslighting someone once said. Fair enough. But it‚Äôs one thing to feel a certain way, an irrational way, another to pay attention to that and let it influence what you believe. The fact is that by a certain point, you no longer believe there is danger, you‚Äôve just come to fear and dread the feelings. There‚Äôs a difference between constantly trying to reassure yourself and reminding yourself of what you truly believe. Trying to reassure yourself just reinforces in your mind that you have doubt.  The relief is short lived. You wind up constantly having to seek reassurance. Instead decide what you believe. Instead ask yourself NOT WITH THE IDEA OF STOPPING SYMPTOMS OR FINDING RELIEF, ‚ÄúDo I really believe this is going to end badly? What happened the last hundred times? So what‚Äôs the most likely outcome on this occasion. Never mind what MIGHT happen some day, what will happen this time?‚Äù Don‚Äôt spend too much time on this trying to make symptoms go away. Be okay with not being okay knowing that as soon as you are no longer focused on it, it will go away on its own. In the meantime let it be there, but off to the side as you cheerfully defy and dismiss it, knowing it will fade as long as you don‚Äôt look at it too intently. Don‚Äôt fight or struggle with it, in other words. As your mind starts to see the positive end result more and more, the episodes will be shorter and less intense.\nThe goal should not be stop anxiety by denying it but lowering it by admitting it and choosing to do nothing. It's not a matter of trying. Trying is not good.\nIt's matter of letting go and leaving it alone. Don‚Äôt struggle trying not to think about it or be aware of it, it‚Äôs a delicate balance. Let your focus on it fade away. You don‚Äôt need effort, effort is struggle. It‚Äôs your attitude toward this you need to work on. The truth is it takes no work, it‚Äôs a quick reminder of your beliefs for the future without trying to accomplish anything now. Relief will come soon enough. For now, you can take it. It‚Äôs your mind, you don‚Äôt need your stupid reptilian brain to dictate your reality. Oh and by the way guess who fed it that reality? You did. Unintentionally of course. Remind yourself of this conviction you have. That there is no danger. Don‚Äôt spend any time convincing yourself or debating the topic. I‚Äôm telling you. I was there. You are safe. You can call it gaslighting, but you aren‚Äôt denying how you are feeling, you are just affirming what you believe. You decide that no matter what you feel physically or emotionally. When you seek relief through assurance and go back and forth, your real motive is to stop symptoms and anxiety. That‚Äôs not much of an assurance if you fear and dread it. A couple of times that you take any evasive action will make it fully entrenched. I got to the point where I would avoid  leaving the house, even though I could have easily tolerated it. Take a step back from that need for emotional and physical relief, that reassurance and watch things start to turn around. You have probably had to relearn this many times. So always remind yourself, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs right, I decided I don‚Äôt believe in this any more‚Äù don‚Äôt monitor it looking for relief, or as I call it in my own mind ‚Äúdon‚Äôt linger there noticing it.‚Äù Don‚Äôt let your continuing to get symptoms make you think you need reassurance to make it go away. This will stop being a problem after you no longer see it as a problem. The symptoms will leave long afterward as long as you don‚Äôt fall back into the habit of seeing it as a problem. This is like a scab. If you pick at it and tear the scab off it will take longer to heal. Leave it alone. ",

        "text": "Around 3-4 weeks ago I went out and was carrying a heavy bag in the cold, which caused some neck pain. it progressively got worse to the point I couldn't sit in class comfortably, and was only in comfort when my head was rested. During class one time I had to present and naturally got a bit anxious, but for some reason it froze my neck up and I couldn't move, and I was having the worst spasms. After it was over I had what I think was a panic attack. I was resting my head on my hand in class and felt like I couldn't move. After I went to the nurse and couldn't stop shaking. The nurse said it could be an adrenaline rush and it would go away. So I went back to school the next day but again got that same feeling of being stuck and unable to move? I haven't been able to go to school for 3 weeks, and have only come in for tests. I have been to the physiotherapist 3 times, it helps relieve the pain but I still feel anxious going to class and keep having neck spasms. One of my tests went well, I wasn't anxious and my neck wasn't in pain. I felt completely normal after and was even able to stay in school for longer. But for the one after I had another anxiety attack and it went pretty bad. The only difference is I was wearing a scarf for the first test and not for the second. But i'm still not sure why it became worse. I came back to school on the 3rd week but was having really bad neck spasms, which weren't as bad before. I was wearing a neck brace as well, which I thought would help but it didn't. After this I couldn't even sit still for my classes after school, and ended up leaving early. When I had tutoring 4 days ago I was completely fine with only slight discomfort. My physiotherapist said it's because I need to be constantly moving, and if i am stiff I will have neck spasms. But how come this wasn't affecting me before as much when my neck pain was worse? She also told me to avoid thinking about my pain because it will cause me anxiety, which will then cause me to stiffen up and spasm, but it's just really hard to not think about it. I have an ultrasound scan on Monday for my neck to clarify that nothing is seriously wrong. But I'm just not sure what to do. ",

What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don‚Äôt see a psychologist because my anxiety isn‚Äôt severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

I really dont like the felling of benzos.  It takes a little practice to get your dose just right, so you don‚Äôt get that smothered feeling, while also taking enough to keep the anxiety down. \n\nWhatever you do, start with very small doses.  If you don‚Äôt feel any relief after 30min or if your anxiety is snowballing, take another small dose. By small dose I mean, break your pill in half.  If it‚Äôs a 1mg, break it in half again (.25)\n\nFinally, whatever benzo you decide on, use all precautions.  They‚Äôre a miracle drug that will absolutely help with panic attacks BUT ONLY TAKE AS NEEDED!  They‚Äôre an absolute bitch to ween off of. I promise you,  no one has ever had a smooth ride tapering off of them if your use becomes too frequent. \n\nWhen you take very small doses and only on an as needed basis, you won‚Äôt need to taper off of them because by doing it this way, even a very small dose will have a big impact\n\nGood luck."

Of course I chalked it up to the Prozac being the cause and that stopping it would be better for me, even though the anxiety you would typically have on it would start in the earlier weeks rather than later and I‚Äôm NOT a professional.\n\nI regret this choice because now that I‚Äôm older I realize that sometimes this is just your bodies way of trying to find the right dose, I probably just needed to get on a higher dose until those symptoms would wear off again and hopefully not come back. I was silly and didn‚Äôt listen to my psychiatrist despite him saying this too and stopped cold turkey. This probably ended up having worse long lasting side effects that I‚Äôm still feeling and trying to recover from now. \n\nTake it from me. Listen to the professionals if they tell you that you need a higher dose, medication is all about trial and error.

I have this fear that a medical emergency will happen to me and they cant help me so i will die or something catastrophic will happen etc. i used to be an alcoholic when i was 14-15 im 19 now and since ive been sober for about 3 years i get nervous when other people are drunk/high and sometimes it escalates to a panic attack. \n\nWhat i do is firstly, remind myself i have the power to call 911 if i need too and if there is an emergency. I also tell myself that just because they are drunk doesnt mean its the end of the world. I stay in my room mostly so i dont have to deal with them and distract myself as much as i can with video games, reading, tv. If you feel comfortable telling your dad it makes you uncomfortable then go for it! But if not thats totally understandable. Unfortunately we cant control what people do but we can remind ourselves that not everything is dangerous and the more we say that the less panic attacks come. \n\nI apologize if none of that made sense i am tired lmao but if you ever need someone to talk to im here üòä"

I get so tense, my body is tense, my jaw clamps shut, when I'm sitting or in bed I'm curled up into a tight little ball. It's not that I lose my sex drive per se, it's more that I feel too tense to relax and enjoy myself. If I have sex during this period I will not orgasm and I'll barely even enjoy it, I feel so tight and robotic, not sensual and sexy. What can I do? I want to have sex, I don't want to leave my man out on a limb for half the year, but I just don't even feel relaxed enough to lay fully flat on the bed, I'm shriveled into a tight little ball. I look at him and I want him but I don't know how to relax.",

I went to the bathroom started dry heaving harder than ever and then my face and hands went numb. i started hyperventilating and i felt so scared in that stall by myself.

It is important for You to put as much effort as possible, without going so far as to burn out, into the usual feel-good activities.\n\nI would also advise seeking professional help given Your previous trauma, and even if that has healed properly, professional advice for Your current situation can only be good for You. Maybe just for a new perspective, which I see You might really need."

I knew they were horrible people and so I had the right to leave them and hate them. But this person literally brainwashed me for 7 years saying horrible stuff about me I still believe. They were the person I was most vulnerable with. I tried therapy but every professional I went they never listened to me, they refused to go deeper and just focused on pills or anxiety (with the old \"think about a relaxing place\", \"meditate\"), not trauma. One even told me \"if we go there we could find things you don't like\" no sht. When I tried to tell them about my grooming they felt disgusted and changed the subject.¬† I'm so fed up with so called \"professionals\" . They didn't even tried art therapy with me even if they knew I was an artist. Just \"tell me about your day\". I repressed and numbed my childhood so much I can't open up so easily and they think I'm not \"trying enough \"."

                "body": "What's happening is that it's not a stupid friend, it was a valued friend, whether toxic or not. You have placed much stock in each other, despite the nature of Your relationship, and this loss must affect You, as it You are only human. It is important for You to connect these two things together - Your closeness and the toxicity. It is possible to become emotionally attached to someone despite their negative influence on You. Becoming aware of this and calling them \"just a stupid friend\" will not work. Severing an emotional bond always hurts, regardless of what You are aware of now. I know what You would probably think of Your long-term romantic partner if You caught them cheating, but this way of thinking about them now and Your ability to suddenly dismiss them does not change the past attachment You must let go of as well.\n\nIt is good that You have gone through these frustrations because You can now narrow down Your search. You know what You are looking for, and You know what it is You absolutely cannot handle coming from your care provider. While frustrating, I advise keeping up the search for a good professional, psychologists and not psychiatrists. Keep lining up potential professional workers, because You only need to find one, regardless if You go through a dozen on the way to that one good worker.\n\nWhile their advice about meditation is not necessarily a bad one, it is not a panacea and just one facet of improving your mental well-being. It is also disappointing to hear that many of Your issues have been avoided, or straight-up invalidated. I feel sadness for the pain You must have felt being invalidated this way because I have went through similar issues.\n\nLuckily for You, You seem to be acutely aware of Your situation, and how You have numbed Yourself to deal with the trauma, and how it is not easy for You to open up. This awareness will make it infinitely easier for someone to work with Your issues, as well as for Yourself, for the parts that You can do on Your own accord.\n\nWhile I understand that You may possibly feel tired, exhausted, frustrated and maybe even cornered, I assure You, a way out exists, and You have been close to it, obviously more than once. Seeking mental healthcare is what is necessary for You, and You have just had bad luck with it, so far. However unfortunate, it is a part of the process that You have to go through, and potentially the most difficult one. I advice recovering Your strength, or exerting it if You have it, to keep at it and find good professional assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, be kind on Yourself as much as possible. You're going through a whirlwind, and everything You feel is unfortunately a natural part of the process. There is no avoiding Your grief and pain, Your stress and insomnia. You are not weak because of it; actually I argue You are strong for being able to live through it. Many have not."

I stayed for more than 5 hours feeling like my heart was going to explode and jumping every time a forklift when whizzing by buzzing their horns. \n\nI kept going to the toilet to try calm myself but when I last took a trip to the toilet I couldn't pull myself back. I was hyperventilating and crying. Someone came into the toilets and I just ran. I didn't know my way around the site and kept getting lost trying to find my way out in panic. \n\nI had to resign, I lasted less than 6 hours. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed.
