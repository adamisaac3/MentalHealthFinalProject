We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what’s going on in your lives. I know it’s easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before. Please feel better and know that you are always welcome back into class. Just shoot us an email and let us know what’s up so we can help you make up the work you missed.\n",

So if you sleep through your alarm and realize you’ll be an hour late don’t feel like you have to just miss the whole thing. If you walk in late, I won’t be mad or single you out, I’ll just be genuinely happy that you’re here and probably at some point will check in just to make sure things are ok. \n\nI also can’t stress enough how important it is to communicate with your professors if you are dealing with anxiety or anything else that might affect your performance in the class. We really do care and the more information we have, the more we can help you. "

        "text": "It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.\n\nHe arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: \"Sorry I have to pull over.\" I reply: \"Ok is everything alright?.\" He says \"Sorry having a panic attack.\"\n\nI remained calm and told him, \"Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.\"\n\nLuckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.\n\nHe wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: \"I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",

I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕\n\nSo after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.\n\nAt the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.\n\nHonestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",

For regular people, anxiety is a temporary and fleeting emotion, at a much lower intensity than we experience it, for much more significant cause than for us...it's an alien concept. It does not compute. They try, but...often fall short. \n\nI have phobias, one of which is public speaking and naturally led to *very* public breakdowns and panic attacks...over and over and over. I never once finished a presentation without crying. Ever. It's awful, and beyond mortifying. Did teachers and professors care? With the exception of two, no (and they were Psychology professors, so likely had a hunch). \n\nThe general public has no idea what a phobia is. A phobia isn't merely something that *scares* you or makes you *uncomfortable,* it's something that causes panic and terror that is completely irrational both in relation to the level of actual danger, and in relation to the degree of the panic and terror. It feels like I am heading to my own execution, like I am literally going to die, although rationally I know that's extremely, extremely unlikely (at least in the case of public speaking) and I would rather do something truly dangerous instead of speak in front of a group...because in my head, skydiving or whatever is *less* terrifying. I will do anything to avoid my triggers. \n\nEverything shakes - voice, hands, knees - I'm lightheaded and dizzy, sick to my stomach and nauseated to the point of vomiting for days ahead of time in anticipation of encountering the trigger. Excessive sweating, rapid and audible pulse, I can't breathe, there's not enough air, I can feel my heart beating under my skin, I can't help but cry, sobbing, I have to get *out*, I'm so scared I can't even form a coherent thought. \n\n*That's* a phobia.\n\nI outright failed a lot of presentations, got some pity Cs which I appreciated - it wasn't *good,* but I did *try,* god damn it. I *tried.*\n\nI work at a mental health agency and it's like a little bubble of kindness and consideration. \n\n- We take mental health days just like regular sick days. \n\n- When someone thinks a hastily worded email might possibly have offended, they'll pop by to apologize and make sure you're okay. \n\n- You did something good, you get showered with praise.\n\n- Mistakes? No big deal, it's okay, we can fix it! Relax! \n\n- You have too much work to do, you're overloaded? Oh no! Here, we can make tweaks to the system to make it easier and faster.\n\n- You're really uncomfortable with this task, it makes you anxious? We'll train you extensively on it so you feel prepared and work to hire someone else to do it instead, take it off your plate!"

You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from \"beating\" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!\n\nAll credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason.

Because it’s never been something I’ve put on my mental to do list. I tend to wash a couple of dishes while I’m waiting for the kettle to boil or waiting for the microwave to ping etc etc and they just get done. \n\nBut mopping the floor becomes an impossible task because I overthink it. “I can’t just mop the floor. I’ve gotta sweep first. Then I have to pick up all the stuff on the floor. Then I’ve gotta make up the bucket etc etc etc. Oh and there’s no point having a clean floor if the stove is dirty. So I have to clean that first and then the wall tiles are gonna look weird if the floor is all shiny. So I’ll have to clean those too... then the windows will need doing. Eh.

My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they’ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn’t worry about it, but for some reason I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?\n\nEDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don’t want to be a broken record either.

I go mute in big groups, and I physically start shaking if I'm too afraid of what will happen depending on what I do or say.\n\nSocial anxiety means you *can't be social*. You get slapped over the wrists for saying the wrong things, or saying the right thing in a suspecting way of your low confidence, that rubs off on other people and they feel irritable and nervous on your behalf and they can't relate to why you're acting like that, so they send rejective signals constantly.\n\nIf you have social anxiety the thought of showing up somewhere where there are other people who depend on things you do, like social etiquette at a party, making food, or doing work, is debilitating in a complete sense.\n\nYou can't show up places. You can't talk normally. You can't exist around others. And they mostly will not understand how you're feeling because life, despite of relationships going wrong and opportunities being lost, to them, was smooth sailing within the confines of \"normalcy\".\n\nI'm not trying to hate on normality. I'm just expressing frustration that I've had to go through some strange feelings in my brain my whole life that I don't find a lot of understanding and support for; that I am too afraid to share with anyone who's not my mom or a therapist, and something I simply don't know how to improve beyond a certain point. I think life will always be uphill for me, and it upsets me because I don't hate solitude, but solitude can't bring you money, and it can't bring you happiness if it's all you have. It makes you *spend* more money on stupid shit like expensive meals, sugar, video games, dumb electronics and furniture, just to compensate for your complete lack of content as an isolating individual. Your room becomes your prison, and life is harder than it's supposed to be. Work is not supposed to feel like a guillotine. It may be hard and seriously suck to do 37 hours a week... but it shouldn't feel like you're about to meet your doom every single morning.

I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it’s for the better. \n\nIf you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.\n\nWe have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.\n\nIt’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!\nSending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.\n\nAnd please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for the awards, I really never thought this would blow up. There are so many comments, I’ll try my best to answer to the most. But as for all the compliments, THANK YOU!! You are all really sweet. You’ve joined the fight with us, you are not alone :).",

It's impossible for me to imagine a life without anxiety, just as it is impossible for them to imagine a life *with* anxiety. I won't lie though, there have been times where I've been full of SO MUCH RAGE that others don't have to live their life in constant doubt and fear. But it isn't their fault. Just as your anxiety isn't yours. \n\nA lot of the time too, people confuse the words \"control\" and \"manage.\" Anxiety is an illness. You don't control how it affects you, but like any and all illnesses you have to find ways of managing it. Coping strategies, ways to help mitigate its affects or ways to deal with the aftermath of an anxiety attack. As many others have said, anxiety is easy to become consumed by. This is what they mean when they say not to let it control you.\nLiving with anxiety is like living with a *really* shitty roommate who will do everything to drag you down, make you feel like shit and stop you from doing what you want to do. Unfortunately for us, they're a permanent roommate. But we can't let them tell us what to do! We have to find ways to make sure their influence on us is as limited as possible."

As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. \n\nAs soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. \n\nBarely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.\n\nIm back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.\n\nI feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success.",

I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it’s too hot, I don’t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I’m relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I’ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.\n\n*Edit to add, I’m also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn’t feel like this but apparently it doesn’t work that way!",

It’s an ingrained idea - and it’s obvious in the hustle/monetise your hobbies culture that’s so pervasive at the moment. \n\nThat aside, being productive is great, but there are plenty of things that are equally or more valuable than being productive. Doing things you enjoy is definitely one of them! Taking time to unwind, destress, play video games, read, browse Reddit, whatever makes you happy, is a valuable and worthwhile use of your time. Is it productive? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I like to think that the ‘product’ is improved mental health, relaxation, happiness - maybe not as tangible as your work days, but arguably more important. \n\nIt’s an easy thing to accept, but hard to put into practice (from my experience, anyway). But I hope that you can work towards letting yourself have unproductive and fun days, as often as is possible - you’re only going to have one shot at life and you may as well enjoy it :)"

Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.\n\nI've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a \"normal\" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.\n\nEDIT: I was not expecting this much of a response from everyone, I am very surprised! I am a little overwhelmed by all the comments, so I'm sorry if I don't respond to you but I am reading them! Thank you so much everyone. You are all lovely people, wishing you all the best!",

I WENT LIKE 100 km/hr!!!!! and then 2 hours back (in the dark!!!) !!!!!!!\n\nI bought myself a whole pizza when I got there and SMASHED IT BC I FUCKING DESERVED THAT SHIT hahahahah\n\nIt’s literally 1:45 am and I’m so fucking happy. If you’re reading this and you’re too scared to do something, DO IT. On the other side of fear is freedom. I feel like I just beat a boss level. \n\nGood night guys, sending you all good vibes.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all your lovely comments and to whoever gave me gold! I’ve posted about this issue on this sub for a while and I’m so grateful for all the support I’ve received. Wishing you all the best. 💖",

He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.\n\nI have a great support system and a wonderful fiancé. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep.

And secondly, yes, initially this was indeed another one of those essays and let me tell you I'm emotionally drained now, still anxious though of course. But instead of deleting everything because of all the \"what ifs\" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).\n\nAlso I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes). I know, there's not really much to answer on here and honestly, it's just one of those days I feel like an improper human being. I think I really need a very long hug.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: paragraphs because of the wall of text (sorry, still learning)\n\nEdit 2: Guys I'm overwhelmed by so many of you who can relate. I truly didn't think that I'd get so many answers, upvotes and even awards from you. If I'm honest I was afraid, that my post would get overlooked. But then I woke up to all the nice messages from you and I appreciate it so much!!! Thank you! I'm going to make myself coffee and read every single one of your comments now.",

Texts, posts, comments, etc.  Once I finish them, I always become overtly anxious about, and aware of how little anyone probably cares, what I think or how I feel.  If this is a form of anxiety, it's the catalyst to my writers block - five years running. \n\nIn fact, I could write an entire emotional essay here about how social media has created an attention span, for generations of people, of fifteen seconds.  And nothing truly heartfelt can be said in so little words.  And how that, alone, has created an anxiety about true communication between people.  People have to edit themselves into oblivion just to be heard, and now to be understood.  If there are too many words, the recipient person gets lost.  There seems to be no need for the details and experiences, and the emotions that language and words can provide, anymore. It's sad.  It's all perfunctory.  Sigh - not the topic at hand.\n\nDon't feel alone.  I'm having one of those days, too, and staring at a computer screen wasting time, and overthinking (as I commented on another post just today - woohoo, new to reddit and already putting my thoughts somewhere).  I think I'll do some work myself and put some emotion into that.  I hope your day is better."

With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. \n\nHowever, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. \n\nThe only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. \n\nI think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. \n\nI’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆\n\n=========\n\nEdit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. \n\nI was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.\n\nTake care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here",

You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.\n\nAll I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. \n\nTo adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big. The past affects your present but it's about how you deal with it that matters.

On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests.

I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.\n\nSo if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",

        "text": "So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.\n\nBut I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .\n\nSo I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.\n\nI don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.\n\nBefore you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.\n\nSo here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.\n\nIf you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:\n\nAt this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.\n\n**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:\n\n* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. \n\n* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.\n\n* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. \n\n**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. \n\n**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.\n\n**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.\n\n**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.\n\n**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.\n\n**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.\n\nOnce you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.\n\nConstant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:\n\nIf you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:\n\n**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):\n\n* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.\n\n* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.\n\n* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.\n\n* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.\nRemember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.\n\n**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:\n\n* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?\n\n* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. \n\n* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?\nIt may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. \n\n**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.\n\n**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:\n\n* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.\n\n* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.\n\n* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. \n\n* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.\n\n**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.\n\nOnce you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.\n\nHovering around 4 - 6:\n\nIf you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:\n\n**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.\n\n**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.\n\n**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.\n\n**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. \n\n**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.\n\nI think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.\n\nAt this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.\n\nOne of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.\n\nAnxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:\n\nYou’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.\n\nNote: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:\n\n**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. \n\n**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.\n\n**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.\n\nThere really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.\n\nThen finally…\n\nNo anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:\n\nThat’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.\n\nI don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. \n\nCongratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.\n_\n\nMy therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. \n\n**Summary:**\n\n**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**\n\n**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**\n\n**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**\n\n**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**\n\n**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**\n\n**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**\n\nThank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/ways-food-affects-your-mood/\n2. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201106/magnesium-and-the-brain-the-original-chill-pill\n3.

An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.\n\nGood luck guys :)\n\nEdit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",

        "text": "I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).\n\nFor some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. \n\nI ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. \n\nI had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. \n\nThe police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like \"WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?\" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.\n\nMy car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. \n\nI am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. \n\nWhat just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. \n\nI'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",

Tragedies can occur at any moment whether you're in a car or not. They provide such great quality of life, I'm willing to risk the danger of driving. I'm not willing to risk the danger of not driving. I can drive people to the hospital. I can drive people to school and work, and greatly improve the quality of their life.\n\nI remind myself that cars are designed to be struck. You could have been a walking pedestrian when that car went off the road, but you were in your car. You were in the safest place you could possibly be. Your car did a good job. I'm so thankful that your car was there for you.\n\nYour experience sounds like a really scary one. I would be quite shaken up for a while. When you get a car again, I would make your first drive to a fun place. Maybe a nearby garden centre? And you can try to look forward to it in the meantime."

I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.\n\nAs a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.",

I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.\n\nIt filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.\n\nI truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.\n\nAlso, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I’m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.\n\nI feel so loved by my thoughtful sons.",

Now when I start to feel anxious I get anxious about my anxiety (lol). \n\nThat being said, I’ve made a LOT of strides in the past two years using mindfulness. Every time I have an intrusive thought (usually inspired by mommy dearest), I label it and let it go. For example, if I’m running late to meet someone and I start to think about how “irresponsible” and “immature” I am, I label them as “intrusive thought” and then stop thinking about it. Now, that doesn’t mean it won’t come back, because it usually does. Sometimes I have to label and let go every second, sometimes it only takes one time. The important thing is you keep going for your health, even if you feel like you’re not “good enough” at it — you deserve it. \n\nIf you ever need a listening ear, I am always here!"

You’re me, obsessively refreshing the worldnews and politics thread because you can’t sleep and you can’t stop thinking about it.  \n  \nAnd then you’re thinking about Australia and the fires, or the flu going around, or how your stomach has been in knots today and you didn’t eat dinner and now taking a shower seems impossible because there’s so much happening and you need to know what’s going to happen next.  \n  \nI want you to know you’re not alone, no matter what happens. I may not know you, but I am right there with you, and we can share this together. No matter what happens.  \n  \nSending you all so many hugs.  \n  \n---  \n  \nDear everyone,  \n  \nI am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just \"ignore\" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  \n  \nI recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  \n  \nWhatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  \n  \n>\"The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.\"  \n- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship",

The footsteps were getting closer and their pace seemed faster than an average stroll.\n\n\"This feels bad,\" My mind said.\n\"It's probably just someone who wants to get home fast.\" My years of therapy and CBT said back.\n\nMy years of therapy and CBT were wrong. I was sexually assaulted that night.\n\nNow, I had and sometimes still have a lot of strong feelings about that night. I was very aware that if not for my anxiety and all the lengths I go to to suppress it, I might have at least not been caught off guard. Did you know that it's things like this that make the mentally ill far more likely to be the victims of violence than they are to commit violent acts?\n\nThat thought makes me so mad.\n\nBut on the other hand, I don't regret therapy or the practice of questioning my anxious instincts. When it was fresher, I sure as heck did. But as incalculably horrible as that night was, questioning my instincts has lead to many more good things in my life than bad things. And questioning and analyzing my feelings since that night has, I believe, helped my recovery. It's slow and some days it still comes back with a vengeance and I still sometimes get mad about it, but on the whole, even knowing that my instincts are sometimes right on the money, I want to always question them. \n\nThere is a part of me that too this day thinks I made the wrong choice that night and resents that I should have to carry the burden of having to question myself at all. That part of me notes that something I can never erase and never forget came from not knowing if I can trust myself. For two years, that part of me was the part that was in control, and I backslid into anxiety and depression HARD. \n\nBad as my memories of that night are, there came a point where those memories were not as bad as living every day at the mercy of my anxiety. So I started questioning again. It hasn't made the memories go away, but it helps me be able to function and be capable of making better memories now. \n\nWhew this is quite the word vomit. I feel like what I'm saying probably makes no sense. But I'm going to post it anyway, because maybe someone gets it.\n"

Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, \"Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.\"\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, \"It's okay. Let's take a walk.\"\n\nWe went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.\n\nI always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.\n",

I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. \n\nShe says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. \n\nIt took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",

It truly sounds like a game changer.\n\nI'll add something else, since I've been working on some similar discomfort-related procrastination issues recently. One of the things that has helped me is to recognize that since discomfort is the problem, if I can decrease the discomfort somewhat, it's easier to get started. I've never done well with rewards, because the fact is I know I can have the reward whether I do the task or not. But if I can build a reward of some sort into a task itself, it can make it feel more manageable. For example, I might make a cup of tea to drink while making a difficult phone call, or listen to fun music while doing an unpleasant chore. Sometimes I'll write down every single step of a task just so I can have the satisfaction of crossing lots of things off my list.\n\nI don't know if any of that resonates with you, but if it does, it might be a way to help yourself ease into your growing pains."

I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.\n\nBut recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. \n\nWhen I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. \n\nI’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. \n\nBest of luck to all of you!\n\nEdit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. \n\nI do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",

Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.\n\nEdit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.\n\nEdit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome.

With something like getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell, I would have little compassion for myself, but if I had anxiety about giving a speech or something \"worthwhile\" to feel anxious about I would say that it's \"understandable\".   Anxiety isn't always logical and it won't always make since in the context of how our society says we are supposed to function. So when I say that \"it should be easy\" I am just lacking self- love. Any act of bravery in the midst of anxiety should be affirmed no matter how small or big, because the consistent disciplined acts of pushing past your anxieties will ultimately make us better. We won't always succeed, but it's the combination of small victories over time that improve us even when the setbacks feel paralyzing.\n\n\\-Peace and love to all you are not alone"

The anxiety got to much to take in February, after 12 months of resisting I started on Sertraline and I’m so glad i did. The underlying feelings are definitely still here, but I’m able to address them and talk about them rather than staying awake until 3am shaking uncontrollably and thinking I’m dying!"

        "text": "Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \n\nSo I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.\n\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. \n\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \n\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. \n\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me \n\nThank you in advance for the help :)",

Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It’s only going to help. Best wishes and good luck!"

Watch the same videos so your mind is used to content and there are no surprises. Just increase the volume by 5% once every few days. Your mind will be able to separate out volume from content. While doing this emphasize in your mind that the *youtube video will never jump out of the monitor to attack you and therefore **it is not a danger**.\n\nThe more your mind associates \"loud sounds\" with \"no danger\", the faster your recovery.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPS: \n\nScreaming / shouting is a big trigger for me and doing this helped me to an extent. \n\nIt helps to ask yourself every time you hear a loud sound:  \n> Is this actually a danger to my life?

I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.\n\nI feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to \"act\" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  \nMy brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.\n\nHas anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it? Sorry if this was long and \"venty\" I just feel trapped in my head! *Takes brain out and throws it out the window* \n\nThank you :-)\n\nEdit: wow thank you everyone for all of your comments. It means a lot that we can share and relate here, to know we are not alone on this. ",

The potential is still there, it's just that you need to heal first.\n\nI'm actually doing a lot better now and have more of that mental sharpness I used to have. I don't feel like there's irreparable damage done from all the years of panic attacks and night anxiety.\n\nIt was when the noise of anxiety lessened that suddenly my mind felt clearer. If you're still lacking that clarity, then there's most likely something still fogging up your mind. It could be anxiety or something more physical.\n\nThat being said, it's not easy finding what the cause is and treating it... Which is why I dislike the notion of \"accept your anxiety. It can't kill you and you can live a normal life if you don't listen to it.\" \n\nI know why this sort of advice exists but it's false. As people, many of us aspire to be a better version of ourselves. To be more optimized, to feel better. It's ridiculous to think that your life and how you enjoy it will be (almost) just as good if you don't obsess about anxiety.\n\nAnxiety lowers your quality of life, period. As a society we need to acknowledge this and stop trying to normalize it to the point that we don't acknowledge the harm it can do. \n\nStill, I wanted to share my experience to provide some hope and perspective :)"

I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.\n\nCut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.\n\nThree months ago I was genuinely in the worst place in my life. Panic attacks sending me to the ER, dozens of doctors appointments, genuinely convinced I was on the brink of a heart attack. But here I am! Perfectly healthy, and so are you.

It has just been a viscous cycle. \n\nUPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II.
