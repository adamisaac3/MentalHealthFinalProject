I was single for 3 years after a (very) messy situation with a woman, and it took a lot of very intentional and productive steps for me to find myself in a spot where I'm more realistic when it comes to dating. I've started seeing someone about a month ago, and it's already turning into something wonderful! Just some tips that I hope can help you:\n\n* Mental Health Wellness - If you suspect you have something, get it checked out! I didn't realize that I had ADHD until my mid 20s along with high-functioning autism, and it completely changed the way I view myself and my habits. Especially when it came to any relationship (not just romantic), I was better able to communicate with people by learning some very helpful ways to express myself. It just HELPS better process my feelings. Coupled with the diagnoses, I had a therapist for about 3 years to help with anything that I was struggling with, including untangling any feelings I had towards someone, especially when infatuation came into play.\n* Journaling - Just an all-around great way to reflect on your thoughts! You're able to vent, then re-read whatever you wrote later down the road. Just having these \"checkpoints\" help with the processing of emotions.\n* Self-Care and Boundaries - BIG one here. Make sure you're constantly communicating with people what your boundaries are, and you'll be able to process things more rationally. There are things that people will do that annoy or bother you, and it'll burn you out. It becomes much harder to process your feelings whenever you're exhausted, so be mindful of the peeps you surround yourself with and how you interact with them. Take days off to focus on your emotional and well-being, and that includes dieting/exercising/hygiene/etc.\n* ***Turn the TV Off*** \\- Deadass trying to bring Kendrick Lamar into this haha but TURN OFF YOUR DAMN PHONE. My life without social media has become SO much more fulfilling, and it really enabled me to focus on the friendships I have now. I'm no longer as insecure as I used to be, and this obsession with romance could stop if you do the same. I literally work in entertainment, and I can tell you this: Romance is, more often than not, a plot tool or simple marketing. I'm not saying romance isn't real, but if you try to follow Hollywood's standard of romance, then prepare to be extremely disappointed. Social media is an even worse place to understand what romantic relationships should look like, but there's a reason why sooooo many social media influencers are viewed as toxic.\n\nThis \"focus on yourself\" thing is a LIFELONG practice, not just to get into a relationship. Even once you get a partner, you HAVE to take care of yourself because, otherwise, you two would develop a co-dependent relationship that isn't on built on two of the most important pillars: TRUST and LOYALTY.\n\nIt seems like you're already doing the right thing by not compulsively looking for a relationship, but it sounds like you need to check-in on yourself and this ***idea*** of romance. It'll happen naturally when you least expect it, and all you can do is make sure that YOU are ready to be in something."

        "text": "Hi everyone, firstly I would like to say that I am happy and proud that you are following this subreddit because you are actively trying to improve your life and most importantly yourself.\n\nThis shit is not easy. Whether you‚Äôre doing fine but just want to make small improvements or you feel like you‚Äôve hit rock bottom. It is very difficult honestly but I commend all of us for trying and seeking out help, motivation, joy, and a better life. Joy should be normal. We do not have to hold on to bitter feelings, self hated, negativity, and pain to ‚Äúglow up‚Äù \n\nWith this being said, the only thing that is getting me out of an over one year hellacious depression is putting love out into this world. This is extremely difficult for me because after all the hell I have been through even though I thought it would never happen to me, I became bitter. I became a person who couldn‚Äôt feel joy. I became numb. I couldn‚Äôt even cry. I couldn‚Äôt even smile. Honestly it felt like strong demons were constantly trying to steal my life force and the beauty of life from me. \n\nBut I want you to know how I feel right now. If I and you continue to hype up our ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù, hate our ‚Äúfaults‚Äù, and magnify issues to the point we think the whole world is against us; we will not get to experience what we all long for. And that is: relief, gratitude, being proud of ourselves, feeling love, giving love and many other things that life has to offer. \n\nLet me tell you, both my parents were alcoholics and drugs addicts and my mother drank while I was in womb, I was neglected and abused as a child with the most painful wounds being the psychological torture, I have experienced SA, I have experienced being degraded, mistreated, lied to, cheated on, scammed, thrown away and many other things. \n\nHowever I have also experienced what it‚Äôs like to experience success, love, care, feeling proud of my accomplishments etc etc. But for over a year now I have mainly felt resentment, nostalgia of the good days, and toxicity. But then I realized that nothing is changing because I am only adding fuel to the fire of the hell I‚Äôve put myself through. \n\nI can‚Äôt control anyone else. I can‚Äôt control the state I live in (FL) (PS: I don‚Äôt recommend it, find you a montainy more beautiful state if you can), I can‚Äôt control random bumps,blockades, or obstacles in the road. However, I can prepare myself to put my joy as the top priority. I can control not being like the people that hurt me. I can control putting the work in to seize my day. And you can too. \n\nDon‚Äôt ever let anyone steal your joy you hear me? Not even yourself. If human beings have made it this far with many catastrophes, that should let you know that you can as far as the dreams you have and then even further. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the opportunities that come from letting this bitterness go. Us letting the pain poison us is not doing anything to the ones who made us suffer. Most people that hurt people just don‚Äôt give a fuck. \n\nI think the most powerful tool is leading by example in terms of being the person you would admire. Because most of the time, the abusers feel real embarrassed once they see they didn‚Äôt convert you into being like them. And even if you bettering yourself doesn‚Äôt make them feel anything, the people and opportunities that come from being the love you put out will be 1000000x more fulfilling.\n\nWith all the negative shit we see on social media, I know it‚Äôs hard to believe there is a bright side. But the truth is, do whatever you can to see it. Even if it‚Äôs just a sliver. We have to allow healing and forgiveness so we can experience the opposite of what most of us have experienced. Which is a lot of bullshit. The world isn‚Äôt over and neither is our lives. \n\nApologize to yourself and if you want, apologize to others or do so in your head if they have you blocked. \n\nI hope that my post has given you hope from the hope I feel from the power of letting go from resentment. I truly believe that a lot of people who read this lives will be changed. Not because of me nor for me but because you the reader have decided  enough is enough. I send peace and love vibes to you guys. Drop a comment sharing your stories and if this helped you in any way.",

Even history facts, tech facts, just theories of things, even things that are useless. \n\nTry to stay away from social media for a 7-10 days and introspect on your feelings and thoughts. \n\nGo to networking events or meetups that happen in your city and meet new people, (you may not want to go out of your house, just force yourself)\n\nWatch non-romantic sitcoms(if you're single), something like Young Sheldon or something like that.\n\nDon't watch thriller movies, mysteries, for a while until you feel fine, also don't listen to sad songs, or songs that trigger certain emotions, it can feel like those songs understand and explain your feelings better but trust me you may not want it on longer doses. \nStand up comedy specials also work really well.\n\nTalk to yourself and introspect about what's going on and what's bothering you and try to solve for those things (I'm repeating the 1st point cuz it's important) \n\nGet a job, part time or full time ( if you don't have one already )\n\nTake a break from your current one if your job is the reason why you're feeling this. \n\nTo know if it's your current job -  Take a 5 days sick leave, without being anxious about you having to do the piled up work when you get back, and if there's a little bit of relief then the job or the work culture is the reason and maybe you've to find a new job.\n\nIf you have a gf/bf or a friend of opposite gender who's understanding, then cuddle with them, without leading it sex.

If you‚Äôve not done meditation before or question how just simply breathing while clearing/observing your thoughts (among other meditation techniques) will make you feel better, I want you to at least try it for five - ten minutes and see. Close your eyes, take deep breathes in and out (ALWAYS make sure your exhale is longer than your inhale, even if it‚Äôs by a second) and instead of trying to get rid of your thoughts, observe them. Don‚Äôt engage, just observe. Imagine your thoughts like a cloud where yes you can obviously see it but you don‚Äôt interact with it nor do you describe what the cloud is. Just observe. Too many times our inner monologue causes us to stress and become an annoyance. Even if it‚Äôs just describing what a tree looks like despite not even being negative? I mean imagine your enjoying nature, but your head keeps mentioning things such as ‚Äúthat tree is big,‚Äù or ‚Äúthose birds sound lovely,‚Äù sure they‚Äôre positive thoughts but imagine if a person in real like kept saying everything they thought to you, it would get annoying so quickly. You could say I‚Äôm digressing from the advice I gave you but I‚Äôm trying to say that you spend too much time questioning the things you do in your head, too many comments being made by your mind and not you. Just observe things rather than describing them. Meditation will help with this and in return will clear your mind and perhaps it won‚Äôt help all that much, it might do, but do at least try."

I was never in a relationship and just recently lost my virginity to a prostitute. I tried x amount of times to improve myself, but failed everytime. I saw my peers living life, getting into relationships, finishing their education programme, starting families and I'm still at the same stage, like when we left school. I lost contact to most people, who were doing well, a lot of close friends I know, struggle with various issues, from drugs to mental health problems. I never did drugs, but I fight with mental health issues. Because of that, I also got physical issues, just recently I realized I'm on the verge to getting bad dental health, because I couldn't get myself to keep to a respective hygiene. Frankly, I have felt like a loser in every aspect of my life for many years now and I'm on the verge of not even caring about that anymore. On to that comes the objective crisis ridden world situation, which doesn't look all to great neither!\n\nBut yesterday, I told myself, I won't stop trying again. I'm setting new goals, got a job recently, moved to a new location and i already feel better. I have strong ADHD, but I know, that when I get regular physical exercise, I have the mental clarity to get the necessary stuff done. It's never too late, the fight has to go on and it will!",

Now, when it comes to expecting attention and validation from people outside of you, the reason it fails is because we put them on a pedestal, and tbh nobody is worthy enough for that kind of importance apart from yourself. Please remember that to begin with. Next, practice self love by being kind and compassionate to yourself, give yourself attention by being active, doing things you love, learn something new, becoming passionate about a new hobby or maybe plan a trip just for yourself, treat yourself with kindness like you‚Äôd have like to be treated (you get the drift) and you‚Äôll notice that your confidence will rise slowly but surely and you‚Äôll find the right people will connect with you and you‚Äôll never actively seek approval from people anymore which will give you a lot of peace. I hope this makes sense. In this process there will be plenty of times you‚Äôll want to jump ship, but I urge you to read books and watch content to help you change your mindset and lastly, do some grounding exercises and just have fun with life (in a healthy and safe way) like there‚Äôs no tomorrow üíÉ"

You're emotionally feeling that you want connection - because you're lonely. \n\nThe reason I think this is you've said that \"not everyone is paired up\" - showing that you're thinking externally about other's relation to you, instead of your relation to others. \n\nThere's a simple solution; logical thinking. \n\nFirst step is this - go ahead and ask yourself why... over and over again. You'll see that each time you ask yourself \"why?\", you'll get to a more logical standpoint, until you're sitting at the root of the problem. \n\nIf this doesn't help, there's another guaranteed strategy - look far into the future and far into the past. If your past seems nostalgic, sad, or something you're hopeful to have back, you're emotionally biased. If your future feels hopeless and unreachable, that's further proof you're emotionally biased.\n\nWhat I found to be the best way to stay \"happy\" is to live within your logical mindset but get motivation through emotional impacts. For example, you have a goal to say \"make \\_\\_ amount of conversations per day\" and you feel motivated to achieve that goal - that's an example of a logical goal backed by emotional fueling. \n\nWhat you're doing is making an emotional goal and trying to fuel it with more emotional feelings, which doesn't work - it is fundamentally unrealistic and that's why you feel \"hopeless\". \n\nI hope this helps :)"

Even made out with a girl. And most of all I just know that more is coming, I've never been like this and I already fit more of the roles that I need to be attractive and I'm just different, so even though there's not too much of the straight out results with girls I want, I'm confident enough that I'll be able to get it and that I already am much better than ever. I had a magic moment after taking a piss today - I saw myself in the mirror and was just like damn, that's chad! I stood there for a few minutes just enjoying it and watching every angle!

        "text": "This is my first time using Reddit so please be nice and gentle :) \n\nFor context, I started smoking weed daily since 2021. I've had only 2 2-month breaks both of which took place this year. Those breaks worked fine for me and I had no trouble stopping. I used to smoke cigarettes socially and vape nicotine vapes daily but I managed to successfully quit vaping at the end of 2023. It was really tough initially as I tried to quit everything cold turkey. I realised that my my addiction to nicotine + oral fixation was really bad so I decided to continue smoking weed until I ran out to deal with my oral fixation and took a 2-month long break after. My cravings for nicotine completely went away after. I soon went back to smoking weed but realised that I should stop so I took another 2-month long break until my friend came to visit me last September. He comes from a relatively conservative country and he wanted to smoke some good buds together so I wound up smoking weed daily again. I would smoke when I wake up, before I eat anything and before I go to bed. I would smoke about 1 & 1/2 joints per day. I do feel lazy and demotivated but I can't stop wanting to smoke. I want to stop doing things half-assed and I'm trying to get my shit together before I start working in corporate next year. I smoked my last joint yesterday and I have already thought about texting my dealer twice. So far, I've been able to put my phone away and keep myself distracted with black friday sales but I keep thinking about smoking again.\nI used to think I can't go anywhere without a vape in my hand but I don't even think about vaping anymore. I'm also convinced that vape is way worse than weed because it's all chemicals whereas weed is natural. I should quit and I think I actually want to quit despite thinking otherwise right now. I guess I'm here in hopes to convince myself to quit by reading what any of you have to say. Any advice/wisdom will be highly appreciated. \n\nUPDATE: I actually wrote this post 2 days ago so my last joint was actually 3 days ago and I'm doing pretty well so far. The day right after my last joint was tough but that was pretty much it üòå",

It takes self awareness, obviously, but it's impossible to have a scenario where everything is good. You can always nitpick. \n\nSo that's step 1 - realizing it's unrealistic. \n\nStep 2 is asking yourself why you enjoy your nostalgia so much? And then do it over and over again - you'll find that you come to a logical conclusion: \n\n* **Why do I like nostalgia and nostalgic moments so much?** \"Because they remind me of happy or comforting times from the past.\"\n* **Why does remembering happy or comforting times feel so good?** \"Because those moments feel simpler and more emotionally satisfying than the present.\"\n* **Why does the past feel simpler and more satisfying than the present?** \"Because I tend to focus on the good memories and forget the challenges I faced back then.\"\n* **Why do I focus on the good memories and forget the challenges?** \"Because my mind naturally filters out negative details over time, making the past seem ideal.\"\n* **Why does my mind filter out negative details?** \"Because it‚Äôs a way of protecting me from unpleasant emotions and reinforcing positive feelings.\"\n* **Why do I need reinforcement from positive feelings?** \"Because it helps me feel secure and hopeful, especially when the present feels uncertain or stressful.\"\n* **Why do I feel uncertain or stressed about the present?** \"Because I have responsibilities and challenges now that I didn‚Äôt have back then.\"\n* **Why do these responsibilities make me long for the past?** \"Because facing challenges today requires effort and emotional energy, while the past feels effortless in memory.\"\n\nThis is one that I generated with AI, but it's just one of the conclusions you can come to - in this specific instance, you'd want to start appreciating effort and set short-term goals to start seeing and appreciating results."

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust a little background before I explain myself:\n\nI'm 17, and I‚Äôve never really been extremely passionate about anything until about two years ago. My grades and GPA were mediocre. In the summer of 2023, something changed‚ÄîI‚Äôm not exactly sure what, but it was around the time I started making my own money (I began re-selling sneakers), and that completely shifted my perspective on everything. From that point on, everything changed. I became obsessed with learning about business and finance. Literally every single second of the day, all I could think about was becoming an entrepreneur. I saved up all my money to start my own business (a different type of business), but it didn‚Äôt go well. Still, I learned a lot in the last few months about the mistakes I made personally and in business.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to today‚ÄîI‚Äôve completely lost interest in school. My GPA went from a 3.5 to a 2.1, and I have mostly F‚Äôs now, but none of that bothers me. At first, my parents were worried and wondered what my plans were, but ultimately, there‚Äôs no way they could convince me to stay focused on school. Eventually, I decided to minimize the time I waste at school and graduate early. I‚Äôm doing online courses so I can graduate this year (junior year). As long as my GPA is above 2.0, my in-school grades don‚Äôt really matter because the online school grades balance it out.\n\nPart of the reason for my grades is that I just don‚Äôt see the point anymore. Before I had this \"obsession,\" I really tried in school but was just mediocre. Yet, I have this friend who‚Äôs the class valedictorian with a GPA over 4.0. He just consumes knowledge like it‚Äôs nothing‚Äîhe plays video games all day, does his homework, and I spend hours studying to get a B+. While he‚Äôll probably go to some prestigious college, get a nice job, and not really have to worry about money, I‚Äôll go to some mediocre college and maybe, in 40 years, if I live frugally, I could become a millionaire. That just sounds awful to me. I see so many adults who have taken this exact path and ended up living miserable lives. I even have teachers who need roommates because they can‚Äôt afford to live on their own. You can‚Äôt expect me to have all this information right in front of me and then say, ‚ÄúSounds good, time for college.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing all this. I don‚Äôt even see college as a plan B. I see it as a last-ditch effort if I truly have nowhere else to go. But I‚Äôm not at that point, and I hope to God I never will be.\n\nFast forward to today, I have a pretty decent job lined up at a startup in December/January, which will include equity, a base salary, commission, and benefits. I‚Äôm also working on my own startup after months of learning on my own and from mistakes in my first venture. Sounds good, right? So what's my problem?\n\nMy social life. I‚Äôve always read about lonely millionaires on Reddit and other places, and my first thoughts‚Äîpresumably most people‚Äôs first thoughts‚Äîare ‚ÄúOh, well, they‚Äôll wipe their tears away with $100 bills.‚Äù But now, I see it. I have some friends, but I never really go out to parties or hang out with anyone. It‚Äôs always just been me, alone, learning and working. At the beginning of this year, a new guy came back to our school after leaving freshman year, and he started talking to me because he had no friends, which I was excited about. But he seemed to get popular almost instantly, and then that faded. I don‚Äôt get it. How do people do that? Social media paints this image that millionaires and successful people work all day until it works, and I‚Äôm willing to do that to make my dreams come true. But I would also love to go to a party with friends every once in a while. Maybe not the smoking and drinking parts, but I want to be in the moment.\n\nThe weirdest thing is that everyone knows me. I feel like I talk to a ton of people every class and between bells, but I‚Äôm beginning to believe I‚Äôm just ‚Äúthat funny guy‚Äù to everyone. Anyone you ask will say I‚Äôm hilarious, but that‚Äôs about it. I know I‚Äôm funny, but I feel like people only talk to me because they want to laugh. It‚Äôs not that people don‚Äôt talk to me outside of being funny. I‚Äôve had girlfriends‚ÄîI'm relatively good-looking and I go to the gym‚Äîbut I just can‚Äôt seem to make that deeper connection with other guys or anyone I really want to be friends with. It‚Äôs frustrating. What killed me is not a single person remembering my Birthday this year. I decided not to post about it this time and not even some of the people I knew best said anything.\n\nIs this road to \"success\" that I‚Äôm on the right choice? Is grinding non-stop, not partying, drinking, or smoking, going to turn me into an unhappy person once I get to where I want to be? Was it all a lie? Can I do both? 60% of my problems will be solved once I hit that number, but, I can't even make solid friends in a place where I see thousands of people my age everyday, wtf am I going to do once I leave? Should I have just tried to be normal?\n\nIt feels like I‚Äôve set up a mental guard in my brain, telling myself to stay disciplined and avoid doing bad things. Now that I want to relax a bit and not be so strict with myself, it feels like that guard won‚Äôt let me.",

Seek out relationships with people who are patient, consistent, and understanding.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling with hypervigilance, remember this: your desire to connect is not the problem.\n\nIt‚Äôs the fear of being hurt that‚Äôs holding you back.\n\nBy addressing that fear, you can open yourself to the genuine, fulfilling relationships you deserve.",

Cardio like running and swimming is for your inner organs like heart and lungs to work more efficiently. Diet and nutrition is for adding or losing mass. If you have more mass than you want then the most effective way is eating less calories. Not less food but less calories. \n\nBut this is going to be the simplest intuitive way to do this. First you're only going to eat breakfast lunch and dinner. No snacks. When you have those meals make sure you eat protein with every meal. Drink mostly water, at least with every meal. If you drink something else find a zero calorie or zero sugar drink. \n\nWalk everyday at least 30mins. This is boring and it feels not intense enough but consistency is the key. Most people read 0 books a day. If you read 10 pages everyday that's 310 pages a month that's like a full novel every month. 12-13 books a year is way over the average of even college level students. It's the consistency that gets you there. Walking burns calories and is low impact. \n\nAnd you don't need to go to the gym to get stronger. Start with Push up, and squats. You can do these at home with no equipment. Say everytime you leave your room you do 5 push ups. If you can't do them with your feet on the ground do them on your knees if you cant on your knees do them at an incline like with your feet on the ground and your hands on a desk so you're leaning at like a 45 degree angle. As you get stronger you can decrease the incline."

        "text": "About 5 years ago I (50 f) shut down and I'm still no where near 'all better'\n\nStopped working, was totally overwhelmed. And the more I asked my spouse to just please be nice the  meaner and meaner he got. Everything was a critisism, everything he'd say was a justification for why he was talking to me like utter garbage. The simplest of conversations will have him ranting and raving like lunatic in no time flat. I can't talk to him about anything at this point.\nEven to say ok you win let's seperate he has to grind into me that is all my fault. That if I'd just tried harder we'd have been fine.   But will get furious and accuse me of constantly bringing up the past if I point out the number of times his instantaneous 0 to 100 rages have ruined a day. We could be on vacation and if one thing goes wrong, he loses his mind and instantly blames me.  We could get a flat tire or and he'd say see we never should have gone on this trip. I'm embarrassed about the conditions our kids were raised in.\n\n\nMy parents are no better. I've gone low contact with them for refusing to respect my boundaries they've both been pretty awful my entire life if I'm being honest.\n\nIn the past 5 years since I shut down, there was litterally years where I could barely leave the house, I'd go out periodically put on act for a bit to  at a function, or run errands, but it would take all my effort., and when I did, it would take days to recover both mentally and physically (I have chronic pain and fibromyalgia)\n\nI've been fighting for disability and trying to get my life back in order, but I for every step forward I make, there are people flinging mud at me and telling me what I loser I am.\nIt's so defeating and made me not even want to try for a long time.\n\nI've been working on self improvement, I've been trying to plan my future knowing my marriage is over. But everything is still so chaotic. I've been approved recently for government disability but I'm still fighting (through legal channels)for the private benifits I had through my employer.  This has been a much longer and more arduous process than I was lead to believe going in.  But here we are years from when I first started fighting,  so working isn't an option right now.  Even if I win, it's not enough to live off of .\n\nI'll be the first to admit living with someone who's struggling has got to be tough. But why wouldn't someone boost up their partner instead of telling them they are lazy and lying about wanting to get better?\n\nI guess this is a 2 part post.  One to rant, because fuuuuck I'm so tired of toxic shitty people. I'm truly a pretty calm and kind person. I don't accomplish as much in a day as people would like. But I'm always doing things for others, and I've really worked to try and get myself into a routine and leave the house on a regular basis.  I've come pretty far all things considered.  I cook, I bake, I keep the house relatively tidy.\n\nBut nothing is ever good enough and they (parents and husband especially) believe I should've been farther along by now. Or never have crashed to begin with. Yet they have done zero reflection on how they have contributed to making this SO much harder!\n\nMy husband is toxically angry and emotionally abusive, he has been for a long time.\n\n I thought the problem was me,  I admit I can get pretty anxiety driven, I'm probably not always easy to be around but he speaks to me in the most vile ways when no one is listening. He is absolutely the victim in all this having to \"endure\" the hardship of a spouse with chronic pain and mental health stuggles.  He sure sells it well to others. \n\nIt's so disappointing. In all other ways he's was actually one of my best friends. But the hard limit I put down was ' be kind' and he's not willing to meet that boundary (nor is my dad)\nSo I have no choice but to end things.  I truly am sad it came to this.  We have a very special house, kids and a grandkid. So much motivation to improve. But he won't 'just be kind'\n\n\nMy second purpose is to ask from others who can maybe relate to this, how did you get your shit together?\n\nI feel so paralyzed, afraid to start, afraid of more contempt and sand being flung at me, so it makes progress a real challenge. But I can't afford to keep stuggling.\n\nPlease don't suggest councelling for myself. Therapists trigger the shit out of me at this point.\n\nAll other suggestions welcome. \n Yes I'm on medication.\n",

The fact that you write it off altogether and think that all therapists will trigger you suggests a poor mindset, a fear of doing things that challenge you, and an aversion to things that don‚Äôt necessarily work out right away. But what I just described is life. \n\nIt also sounds like you tend to victimize yourself the same way you say your husband does. What you‚Äôve described does sound awful, but you aren‚Äôt powerless. \n\nThe way you get your shit together is to get outside your comfort zone and put effort into something that challenges you, but will ultimately be good for you (I.e. finding a good counselor). But that applies to other things too, not just finding a counselor.  ‚ÄúFollow the fear‚Äù is what I say to myself when I‚Äôm in similar predicaments where I‚Äôve let fear and anxiety debilitate me. Other than counseling, what else have you entirely written off because it triggers you? In those things might be where you find some answers. \n\nYou also have to take your power back. You are not the hapless victim of your parents, your husband,\nOr your mental health. Stop focusing on the uncontrollables. What *can* you control? Can you save up bit by bit to move out and find your own place? Can you start going on long walks (ideally in nature) to ground yourself? Can you lean into your favorite hobby, or find a new one? Can you start volunteering to keep yourself busy, do something that makes you feel good about yourself, and connect with others? Can you go completely no contact with your parents? Reconnect with an old friend? There are so many things you can control, OP. And your mental bandwidth should be going towards those things. Not what other people say/do, which we can‚Äôt control. \n\nAnd please, please reconsider getting counseling. At worst, you‚Äôll do something outside of your comfort zone even if it doesn‚Äôt work out. Remember, whether or not you‚Äôre triggered by a counselor is largely up to you. You are in the driver‚Äôs seat of your emotions. At best, you‚Äôll find a champion who can help you create an effective treatment path. \n\nYou gotta want it, OP. Trite, but true. \n\nBest of luck."

My belief that the opposite is possible amongst ourselves is simply impossible is almost religious. Maybe there are stories where it's an inversion, aversion or exaggeration of what's real, and they don't sit well with me.

It is generally used for more complex mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety disorders, trauma, or personality disorders.\n   - Therapists (often licensed psychologists, social workers, or counselors) may utilize various therapeutic modalities such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to help individuals explore deep-seated emotional issues and patterns.\n   - Therapy focuses not just on addressing immediate symptoms but on working through underlying issues over time.\n\n2. **Counseling**:\n   - Counseling is often more **short-term** and solution-focused. It typically addresses specific challenges, such as stress management, relationship problems, or life transitions (e.g., grief or job changes).\n   - Counselors may help individuals develop coping strategies, improve communication skills, and provide emotional support during challenging times.\n   - While counseling may involve therapeutic techniques, it tends to focus more on practical problem-solving and providing guidance.\n\nIn short, **therapy** is often more comprehensive and long-term, while **counseling** is typically more focused on specific issues or challenges with a shorter duration. However, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, and the distinction can vary based on region or professional context."

        "text": "Today will be a short one. I didn't have a bad day but I really didn't feel good for some reason. I kind of just felt sick and allowed myself to relax for most of the day. My hamstrings were still killing me and my body overall just felt sore. From pushing at the gym to the Turkey Day food, my body felt spent. I'm not sure what it was in particular because I didn't feel like this after my actual Turkey Day with family but I was very active that day. I was everywhere trying to have fun and hang out with family. I hung out with my little cousins who are always a workout to be around. They are fun now that they are older but my goodness they tire me out. I didn't have all that working out with them on Turkey Day so maybe the food was weighing me down even more this time. My body just felt worn down today and I did a lot of sleeping. The highlight of my day was getting my new shoes and liking the way they felt on my feet. They feel good. They aren't perfect on my feet but feel better than what I was walking on for a month and a half. I was very thankful towards my mom for picking them up and paced around in them for a bit. I always loved getting new shoes before school started when I was younger. Even though it has changed a bit since I have gotten older, the feeling of something new is always great. I needed this as well just like my car needs new shoes. One step at a time though. It was a long day though because of how I felt. I tried to find different ways to feel better to no avail. I took a nice shower to end my day off hoping to ease some of the soreness. I then doom scrolled a bit and deleted some tabs. I made my day as productive as I could with feeling this way. Tomorrow will be better and hopefully my hammies will have forgiven me. Here is what I put in my belly (leftovers):\n\nBreakfast:\n\n1 slice of toast - 100 calories (3 g protein)\n\n32 g of peanut butter - 190 calories (7 g protein)\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n62 g of homemade meat stick (compared to Jack Link‚Äôs)  - ~285 calories (~14.3 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n73 g of Turkey - ~90 calories (~11.8 g protein)\n\n187 g of mashed potatoes - ~210 calories (~3.7 g protein)\n\n28 g of cheese - 90 calories (7 g protein)\n\n30 g of cranberry sauce - ~50 calories (~.3 g protein)\n\n105 g of green bean casserole - ~90 calories (~2 g protein)\n\n156 g of peppers - ~55 calories (~1.8 g protein)\n\nDessert:\n\n65 g of cranberry sauce - ~105 calories (~.6 g protein)\n\nLeftover candy - 50 calories\n\nSnack:\n\n1 serving of popcorn - 140 calories (5 g protein)\n\nSBIST was the feeling of being lucky enough to have days like this. I feel lucky that I have a life where I can rest when I don't feel good. Not everybody has that luxury in life and doesn't have the ability to rest when things are down. Like anybody else I can take that for granted and not realize the good things I have. This doesn't mean I shouldn't have the ability to feel sad or that bad things happen to me, but it means some days I should count the blessings I have rather than the bad things. I guess the beauty I found in a negative day like this is that I can rest and recover to have an even better day the next. \n\nTomorrow the plan is to feel better and get some stuff done. I don't believe I will have any work to go in for but I need to hit the gym for a light workout and need to grab some fruits and veggies for sustenance. Besides that I want to delete some tabs and continue looking at deals on things. I found one or two things I want to purchase. I also need to grab a few gifts for people. After that I can just keep money for tires and tire installation. I need to do some research on that as well so I'll hop to that soon. Thank you my conjurers of the deals on deals. You make me consider purchases I would have never done. \n",

And to be honest the problems are deeply rooted and I will have to continue working on them for years I believe and I have no problem with that.\n\nDespite my best efforts to improve from what I was and the fact that I see what I did wrong I am still unable to forgive myself and it haunts me when I am not distracted it's even made it hard to sleep most nights.\n\nI think the main reason is that I'm scared if I forgive myself I will go right back to being awful or something I'm really not sure why I think that though. I like to think I'm not truly a bad person to my core but this thought seems to stick around along with some nasty self talk I haven't been able to shake off that may be because I can't forgive myself :( .\n\nAny tips or just general stories of how any of yall have dealt with something similar would be of great help sorry if I rambled a little it's a bad habit of mine when talking about emotions.\n\nThank you for reading!",

I realized that everybody makes mistakes, all types of mistakes. They are not perfect, neither do me and you. I see that you have taken the first step, knowing that you apologized and know what you did wrong. I dont know what you did but.. the past is the past, use your knowledge of what didn't work and use a different method. \n\nYou are not a bad person. You just need to talk to yourself some kind words like \"I makes mistakes and that's okay.\" You are getting there by saying \"I'm not truly a bad person.\" Keep on saying that but without the nasty self talk, and yes, it will takes some time for you to reduce that sentence. I'm getting there too.. \n\nFor me, I need to gain some confidence in myself because I have social anxiety. So, I have to go out there and say hi to people.. What's is your next plan? Getting therapy? \n\nI use journaling to write about my day or write down my emotions if it were bothering me so much. I use to plan my action in the present so that I wont make the same mistakes what I did in the past. Start by doing 1 small goal like talking to one person and gradually adding one person each day/week. \n\nOr maybe try meditating..? Like setting a time to feel all your emotions and letting it go by inhaling and exhaling deeply. Although, I haven't used it in a while.. But, it will be nice for you to try for two week?\n\nGood luck on wanting to improve yourself!"

Have the croissant but team it up with an apple. Have the pizza but have a side salad. Be aware of pointless calories that don‚Äôt bring you joy and reduce where possible- alcohol is a big one/ sugar in drinks generally, salad dressing and oils is another. \n\n- Perhaps mix up your exercise routine to include more HIIT and weight training. You may want to be ‚Äúslim‚Äù but your body in the future will thank you for also being strong and well stretched out. \n\nI‚Äôd love Zumba, find activities you find enjoyable that will raise your temperature, try to adjust sedentary activities like watching TV or using your phone by hulahooping, doing squats or investing in a standing desk. Walk as much as you can, park further away from the entrance or get off the bus a little early and where ever possible try to increase your pace. \n\nLiving in London I enjoyed playing a game of overtaking and slinking through a crowd.

        "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nI‚Äôm 20, and I‚Äôm in my 3rd year of university studies. I study and work 6 days a week and have only Sundays off. There is no way to free up more days, since the university schedule is immutable and all 6 days have mandatory classes to attend.\n\nI hike frequently, I‚Äôve got a whole bunch of hobbies, mostly outdoor ones (storm chasing, amateur astronomy, etc.), but with only 1 day off per week it‚Äôs hard to fit anything that I like into the very limited time I have. \n\nIt seems like my life is becoming an endless cycle of commuting and carrying out obligations. And thus, it feels like I‚Äôve had a worse mood and a more negative outlook ever since this schedule was set in place. I‚Äôm not doing too bad at studies, but I have to admit I‚Äôm really dissatisfied with my life right now.\n\nI realize that I‚Äôm very privileged to be able to attend a university. I also understand that it‚Äôs time for me to grow up and not expect as much rest as at school. \n\nBut my question is for those people who have studied/worked 6 days a week: how did you make your life less ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù-ish and less bleak? What did you dedicate your only day off to? And in general, how to keep your head up when there is just too little ‚Äúme time‚Äù?",

There are a lot of people that extend their study to work and fit their social life and others that get their head down and push. Consider yourself proud since not everyone can push 6 days a week for a prolonged time. See it as \"you're pushing and delivering results where others crumble and skip exams or courses to might even get stuck being a student\". It will pay off, proof you for later and make you appreciate your free time once it comes for you\n\nThe older you get, the more you will find ways of dealing with the stress and how to balance free time with work time. I can highly recommend you to e.g. find podcasts or books about the topics that interest you and listen to them during your commute. This way even a way to uni feels more like getting a glimpse of what you enjoy instead of just going to grind yet another day."

You have to play as 6 people so you grow together like a family, your good or bad play is reflected on your teams, but you also have the serve where you are alone and hitting a couple of aces makes you feel like you carry the team.

As you grow, friend groups naturally shift, and while that‚Äôs tough, it also means there are so many more people out there who might share your vibe. Your friends don‚Äôt have to have the same interests as you, and comparing yourself to them or anyone else is only going to steal your joy. Focus on what makes you happy, and you‚Äôll find the people who really click with you.\n\nI was the \"weird kid\" in school with different interests too, and honestly? I found more of my people online than offline. Once you stick to being yourself, the right kind of people will gravitate toward you. Engage with those who make you feel welcomed and appreciated. Friends will definitely keep changing.\n\nAlso, I think that grade is pretty solid! An 88 isn‚Äôt bad at all. You're still too young to stress about grades. In your age, I did worse than you and now after finishing high school, I can say that I changed a lot to the point where I exceled in the subjects I enjoyed studying. Maybe explore other hobbies you enjoy, or dive deeper into what already lights you up.

        "text": "A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Self-Doubt\n\nEver felt like a fraud despite your accomplishments? You're not alone. Imposter Syndrome affects millions of high achievers, casting a shadow on their success. Let's explore the challenges it brings.\n\nThis is the second article in a series of ten exploring imposter syndrome. In this piece, we will explore the challenges faced by those experiencing Imposter syndrome.\n \n\n\nThroughout the series, we will use this definition of Imposter Syndrome:\n\nImposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent, internalised fear of being exposed as a fraud. Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing Imposter Syndrome remain convinced that they do not deserve their success or accolades. They may attribute their achievements to luck, timing, or deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and capable than they believe themselves to be. This can lead to significant stress, anxiety, and a reluctance to take on new challenges or opportunities.\n\nThe key issue is the incongruity between the individuals‚Äô perception of their competence and worthiness versus that an objective external observer.\n\n\nImposter Syndrome: The Challenges\n\n1. Self-Doubt: persistent doubts about their abilities, skills, and accomplishments despite objective evidence of success.\n2. Fear of Failure: intense fear of making mistakes or failing, leading to anxiety and avoidance of new opportunities or challenges.\n3. Perfectionism: setting unrealistically high standards and being overly critical of their own performance, exacerbating feelings of inadequacy.\n4. Inability to Internalise Success: attributing success to external factors such as luck, timing, or help from others rather than their own abilities and hard work.\n5. Overworking: compensating for perceived inadequacies by over-preparing or working excessively to avoid being exposed as a fraud.\n6. Avoiding Praise and Recognition: discomfort with receiving praise or recognition, typically downplaying or dismissing positive feedback.\n7. Comparing Themselves to Others: frequently comparing themselves unfavourably to others, which reinforces feelings of inferiority and inadequacy.\n8. Fear of Exposure: constant worry that they will be ‚Äúfound out‚Äù or exposed as a fraud, leading to chronic anxiety and stress.\n9. Impaired Professional Growth: reluctance to seek promotions, new roles, or career advancements due to fear of not being competent enough.\n10. Emotional Exhaustion: the ongoing stress and anxiety associated with Imposter Syndrome can lead to burnout, emotional exhaustion, and decreased well-being.\n\nThe Outcomes I often see in my Solution Focused practice:\n\n1.\tChronic Anxiety: Individuals with Imposter Syndrome often experience high levels of anxiety and stress due to their fear of failure and being exposed as a fraud. This chronic anxiety can lead to generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and other stress-related conditions.\n‚Ä¢\tConstant Worry: the fear of being exposed as a fraud can lead to chronic anxiety, with individuals constantly worrying about making mistakes or not living up to expectations.\n‚Ä¢\tHigh Stress Levels: persistent anxiety often results in high levels of stress, which can impact both mental and physical health.\n2.\tPerfectionism: perfectionist and overworking tendencies of individuals with Imposter Syndrome can lead to burnout, characterised by physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy.\n‚Ä¢\tUnrealistic Standards: those with Imposter Syndrome often set unrealistically high standards for themselves, striving for perfection in every task.\n‚Ä¢\tFear of Failure: the intense fear of making even minor mistakes can lead to excessive effort and burnout, as individuals feel they must be perfect to avoid being \"found out.\"\n3.\tAvoidance of Challenges:\n‚Ä¢\tMissed Opportunities: fear of failure or exposure may cause individuals to avoid new opportunities, challenges, or responsibilities that could lead to growth and advancement.\n‚Ä¢\tStagnation: avoidance can result in career and personal stagnation, as individuals remain in their comfort zones rather than taking risks that could lead to significant achievements.\n4.\tLow Self-Esteem and Self-Worth: Imposter Syndrome can erode self-esteem and self-worth, as individuals continually feel inadequate and unworthy. Low self-esteem can perpetuate a cycle of negative self-perception and further exacerbate mental health issues.\n‚Ä¢\tNegative Self-Image: despite external validation and objective evidence, individuals with Imposter Syndrome often struggle with low self-esteem and a negative self-image.\n‚Ä¢\tSelf-Criticism: they may be overly critical of themselves and their abilities, frequently discounting their achievements and focusing on perceived flaws or failures.\n5.\tDepression and Emotional Exhaustion: persistent self-doubt and negative self-evaluation associated with Imposter Syndrome can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression. Individuals may feel they are not worthy of their success, leading to depressive symptoms.\n‚Ä¢\tDepressive Symptoms: constant pressure and feelings of inadequacy can lead to symptoms of depression, including persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and fatigue.\n‚Ä¢\tEmotional Burnout: the ongoing stress and emotional toll of feeling like a fraud can result in emotional exhaustion and burnout, making it difficult to maintain motivation and energy levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe intersection of Imposter Syndrome and mental health is complex and multifaceted. Understanding these challenges can help in providing comprehensive support to individuals with Imposter Syndrome. Addressing these interconnected issues through a holistic approach can lead to more effective and sustained improvements in their mental health and overall well-being.\n\nTaking a holistic approach can be very different from what we have become accustomed to:\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"What is wrong with me?\" with \"What have been my experiences?\"\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"What are my symptoms?\" with \"How have I adapted to my experiences?\"\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"Help should be focused on individual symptoms and behaviours\" with \"Help should be focused on the whole person, recognising they live within systems that impact them.\"\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"Clients are sick, ill, or bad\" with \"People are generally doing the best they can, given their circumstances.\"\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"Medics are the experts, so they take control\" with \"Helpers collaborate to support the client in developing their agency.\"\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"Outcomes are set by the medic\" with \"Outcomes are agreed between the client and the helper.\"\n‚Ä¢\tReplace \"Help is focused on managing symptoms\" with \"Help is focused on implementing solutions for sustainable well-being.\"\n\nContinue reading the series to explore Imposter Syndrome in depth and build your own toolbox to sustain your well-being for the long term.

                "body": "Navigating through such feelings can indeed feel like a weight that‚Äôs hard to lift, but it also reveals something profound about human connection and self-discovery. It sounds like you‚Äôre searching for a sense of balance‚Äîa way to reclaim the energy you‚Äôve poured into others and redirect it inward. The journey to being okay on your own begins not by severing attachment but by gently understanding and re-centering it.\n\nSometimes, it helps to view relationships as reflections. They show us parts of ourselves we might not yet understand, but they‚Äôre not the entirety of who we are. In a book I‚Äôve been exploring, The All, it speaks to the idea of duality and unity: the balance between giving and receiving, connection and solitude. It‚Äôs in solitude, ironically, that we often find our truest connection‚Äîwith ourselves, with the present, with a sense of completeness that‚Äôs not contingent on external validation.\n\nYou mentioned journaling feels counterproductive, but perhaps there‚Äôs an opportunity to reframe it. Instead of writing about your relationships or the emotions tied to others, explore your dreams, your desires, your ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù What lights you up when no one else is looking? What does freedom‚Äîreal, unshackled freedom‚Äîlook like for you?\n\nMeditative practices, even simple breathing exercises, can help ground you when your mind feels like a prison. Bringing attention to your breath reminds you that the present moment, this very inhale and exhale, is yours and no one else‚Äôs to dictate. It‚Äôs a step toward aligning with your own flow.\n\nRemember, healing is not linear, and neither is growth. You‚Äôre not alone in this feeling, and perhaps what you‚Äôre missing isn‚Äôt outside you at all‚Äîit‚Äôs already within, waiting to be gently unearthed. Reflect on that, and trust that this part of your journey is a preparation, not a punishment."

Because you will always have you and if you love you then if you lose someone it won't be such a fall from grace.\n\nThat's what I'm working on anyway! But I'm 35 so a little older!"

To make matters worse, My kids witnessed the attack, we were homeless earlier this year, and the emotional toll it‚Äôs taken on them has been devastating.

If your budget is too tight for protein powder, try eating green grams, eggs, horse grams and groundnuts as they are good sources of protein and they are cheap too."

        "text": "Own Your Journey: Empowerment Through Self-Awareness\n\nDid you know that dedicating just a few moments each day to reflection could unlock a more fulfilling life? Discover how in this concise guide on self-awareness.\n\n\nWhat is Self-Awareness?\n\nSelf-awareness, as defined by the dictionary, is ‚Äúknowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.‚Äù \n\n\nSelf-awareness sits at the core of our personal development and wellbeing. It involves truly knowing oneself ‚Äì understanding personal preferences, motivations, strengths, weaknesses, and the principles guiding your life. Think of self-awareness as a compass, providing clarity and direction in navigating life's complexities. It goes beyond mere likes and dislikes; it entails a deep understanding of what drives you, what defines you, and the habits that shape your daily existence.\n\n\nWhy Developing Self-Awareness is Important\n\nSelf-awareness is more than just a psychological buzzword; it's a powerful catalyst for life transformation. When you deeply understand your inner workings, a path to a more enriched and fulfilled life unfolds.\n\nFirstly, self-assuredness becomes your greatest asset. Thorough self-knowledge empowers you to confidently navigate life's challenges. Criticism becomes constructive feedback, fueling personal growth and development.\n\nMoreover, understanding your motivations is essential. Whether fueled by love, passion, or financial incentives, recognizing these driving forces sheds light on your choices and actions. Acknowledging strengths and weaknesses sets the stage for continuous improvement.\n\nLiving by a set of principles, whether personal beliefs or external guidelines, adds depth to self-awareness. These principles serve as a compass, ensuring your actions align with your values.\n\n\nPractical Steps to Increase Self-Awareness\n\nIdentify your preferences: Start by recognising your likes and dislikes. Whether it's a disdain for certain activities or a passion for others, acknowledging these preferences sets the foundation for self-awareness.\n\nUncover Motivations: Reflect on what truly motivates you. Is it love, personal interest, or financial gain? Understanding your driving forces illuminates the path to a more purposeful life.\n\nAssess Strengths and Weaknesses: Take stock of your abilities. Identify strengths to leverage and weaknesses to address for personal growth.\n\nDefine Your Principles: Consider the principles guiding your life. Whether rooted in religion, family values, or personal beliefs, recognising your principles enhances self-awareness.\n\nReview Your Habits: Habits reveal a lot about you. Identify and understand your daily routines, as they define you and offer opportunities for positive change.\n\nEmbrace Feedback: Open yourself up to feedback. Honest insights from others provide a fresh perspective, enriching your self-awareness journey.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the more self-knowledge you acquire, the more consciously you can navigate life's intricacies. Embrace self-awareness as a continual process, and experience its positive impact on your daily life. Elevate your self-awareness for a more rewarding and fulfilling life.",

        "title": "Losing A Half Of Me - Day 212",
        "text": "Today was a very fun day. It was Turkey Day and the day before Black Friday. The gym was closing early and I woke up to my hamstrings killing me. I couldn't even bend over properly without feeling those puppies. I both loved and hated it. Loved knowing they are getting stronger but hated the pain in the moment. They will heal though and I will continue to push. Even if I wanted to hit the gym early, there was so much snow on the ground. It's like Christmas wants to come even earlier. I spent my day deleting tabs and looking at deals on Black Friday. It was such a relaxing day and it felt nice. My mom asked if I would have dinner with her and we did. Lately she has been cooking more and it's been very helpful with me saving money and I think me trying her food has been making her happy. I weighed out the different sides and the Turkey and felt comfortable with what I ate. I kind of fasted but drank chocolate milk to tide me over until dinner or the big event. I ate a bunch of turkey and green bean casserole and loved it. I have hated my mom's green bean casserole for the longest time. My guess was that I had it so much over the years that I started to dislike it. Then I decided why not and went for some. I absolutely adored it and put some Tabasco on it. It isn't too high in calories and tasted fantastic. I decided I have to make my own completely from scratch for the Christmas dinner I want to make. I also had the cranberry sauce from work and oh my goodness it's so good. I didn't need dessert because this was phenomenal. I came up with an idea for next Thanksgiving since I have been bringing dessert the past couple years. My idea is to make donuts since they are my absolute favorite. I love jelly donuts and I think making a cranberry sauce filled donut would be excellent. Both festive and a great dessert. It would give me a reason to start experimenting more with baking and especially experimenting with one of my favorite things. My mom and I ate together and we usually watched a cooking show a few years ago. We couldn't get it to work so I put on one of my favorite YouTube videos. A mock game show of Taskmaster and she loved every second of it. I think it is the video I have laughed hardest at. It was an amazing production and I love Taskmaster in general. We had a really good time and talked to one another a bit after. She is going out for Black Friday and will also be swinging by one store to grab my newly ordered shoes. I found a good deal for Black Friday and decent shoes in my budget. I hope they feel well over time but working towards a better job also comes with better shoes. These seem highly praised and work for a budget. I can't wait to have something better for my feet. Besides all that amazing fun here is what I ate:\n\nMidday Snack:\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n244 g of turkey - 305 calories (37 g protein) \n\n81 g of stuffing - ~310 calories (~5.6 g protein)\n\n163 g of mashed potatoes - ~185 calories (~3.2 g protein)\n\n90 g of cranberry sauce - ~145 calories (~.8 g protein)\n\n569 g of green bean casserole - ~495 calories (~10.6 g protein)\n\nSBIST was the beautiful meal my mom put together for us. It tasted great and we had a nice meal together. We don't eat together anymore and do our own things typically. It was just nice to watch something together and eat food that I really appreciated having. The turkey came out perfect and wasn't dry. She made some good stuffing and made real mashed potatoes. I swear most people just make the boxed ones at this point in my family. The stuffing was simple and the cranberries from work were divine. I am used to hating on green bean casserole but enjoyed it this time. It was a lovely dinner and I enjoyed it.\n\nTomorrow the plan is to stay home and eat leftovers for the most part. I may go out to work out and grab some veggies but my hamstrings were killing me today. I couldn't even bend over without feeling it. I am happy knowing that my muscles are getting worked on but man it is destroying me in the short term. But I went in knowing this journey is all for the long term results. I know this ‚Äúpain‚Äù will make it so I won't have back pain in the future from being overweight or heart problems from limiting how much food I eat now. These habits will make me better even if sometimes I hate them. Little cons for even bigger pros. Thank you my conjurers of the pros and the cons. You make me find the right balance until the cons get weighed away physically and metaphorically.  \n",

But I've maintained my weight by doing simple things, which is a huge different from where I was at a few years ago (when I was hitting \\~250, now at 200). I do light exercises currently, but planning on shedding this holiday fat starting soon! Helps that I'm currently making more changes to my diet thanks to my sister's new dietary restrictions.\n\nThat said, based on your list, I HIGHLY recommend having a decent breakfast! Something with a ton of protein and less carbs help. You mention corn cereal, so why not have a small bowl of it with a protein shake? Or just a protein shake with some fruits. I like to have a chocolate protein shake (there's a great plant-based one that tastes great and isn't creatine based) with bananas, blueberries, and a handful of spinach (you barely taste it).\n\nAlso, a neat trick: Try going without GLUTEN. It made a HUGE difference for me, probably the biggest! Aka nothing with flour - so no bread and pasta. If you can find alternatives, great! Sprouted bread is surprisingly good (at least better than whole wheat flavor and texture wise), and mix in brown rice into white rice. I consider potatoes okay, but I'm still careful with them.\n\nOther than that, your diet seems pretty manageable! I still have 1-2 cheat days, and I sometimes have a fasting day whenever I eat a ton throughout the week.\n\nOne thing to note: Make sure you're mixing up your meal times! Small meals throughout the day are generally what I go for (like 4 small meals and a couple of snacks a day), and emphasize proteins over carbs.\n\nGood luck!"

However, as I mature, I have begun to worry that I am a pushover or doormat and that I should try to break this pattern.\n\nMy friend, and I really consider him to be my best friend (I am not the most social person), is back in town for the Thanksgiving holiday. We have always gotten along well and talk often, despite not having seen each other in months. We agreed to hang out this afternoon and then again in the evening, before he leaves town again.\n\nHowever, he decided to go to a college house party for a while in between our hangouts, and then the plan was to meet at his house, make a fire, and so on. He did ask if I wanted to come to the house party, but that is not my kind of scene and I had told him as much.\n\nWe agreed to meet at a specific time at his house once he was done, and while he was at the house party, he texted me several times, first to confirm, and then several times to delay.\n\nAn hour after the initial time we planned to hang out, he called me to say that he was having fun and he didn‚Äôt want to leave the party. I told him not to worry and to have fun, but when he asked me again to come to the party, I told him no. \n\nThis is very unlike me as I always say yes to everyone as I mentioned, and those closest to me have told me before that I can be a bit of a doormat, an idea that I have always dismissed. However, this whole event got me thinking about prioritizing and respecting myself, so when my friend asked me to come, I said no. I gave the excuse that it was late, and reminded him that this was not where or how I had agreed to hang out with him.\n\nI decided not to elaborate because he was still at the party and I didn‚Äôt want to spoil it for him on my account. However, similar things have happened to me several times before with this friend and others. Without going into too much psychology, I can see where my desire to always please everyone and bend over backwards for people comes from.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of this with my friend, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to jeopardize our friendship which is so important to me. I do feel though that sometime soon I should communicate to him how this made me feel, and that I feel if we are friends, he should respect my time.\n\nTL;DR: I finally put my foot down and declined to go to a party with my friend who didn't keep his word.",

I shouldn't have been so dumb to think it would lead me a better life. It did nothing but make me lose money, years of work experience, and past friends. Some of my friends never attended college and they decided to work instead and now they have more money than me. One friend didn't even finish high school yet he managed to get a job and work all these years and outearn me. But what did i do? I decided that college would be beneficial for me, so i studied and had no jobs after graduation.\n\nAt the moment i have a minimun wage job at the age of 24 and I have completely wasted my life where i could have done other things. All those years just thrown. I am depressed and feel extremely resentful. My parents keep telling me to have patience and hope but it's just words now. I am in a terrible spot where i am thinking about taking different paths in life, some that are unfavorable and may put my family in a dangerous position. An old friend did this but got shot and had to leave the country. Idc anymore. I tried to apply for jobs and spent so much trying to sell myself in the best way possible and I still get rejected. My friends have jobs with better income than me without a college diploma and I am starting to distance myself from people because of this.\n\nSorry for letting all the negativity out. I kinda needed to get this off my chest. Any advice?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support and advice, it means a lot. For those wondering, my current job is personal assistant for mentally disabled people, i like it a lot but it has nothing to do with my major. My major is business economics with finance and HR. I have a year of military service and 2 years of work experience in my current job, that's about it.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a 26f, doing my masters in France. While I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to live and study here, I‚Äôve been grappling with a sense of dissatisfaction and lack of discipline that‚Äôs holding me back from becoming the person I aspire to be.\n\nHere‚Äôs a snapshot of my current challenges:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tHabits and Hygiene: There are days when I skip showers because it‚Äôs too cold or procrastinate on doing my laundry until it‚Äôs overwhelming. My room and cupboard are often messy, and I keep putting off cleaning until it feels impossible to start. I‚Äôm just not naturally very hygienic and I don‚Äôt know how to cultivate something that just isn‚Äôt part of my personality but in fact is something that can make such a huge difference to my confidence . I have body hair, too lazy to take care of myself , organize my space or even take action to make life easier \n\n\t‚Ä¢\tHealth and Appearance: I don‚Äôt follow a balanced diet, and my hair care is practically nonexistent, leading to significant hair fall. I rarely dress up or put effort into how I present myself. Most days, I leave the house in casual jeans, a T-shirt, and a jacket. I feel disconnected from my feminine side and the confidence that comes with feeling good about how I look. Somewhere I feel like internally I don‚Äôt even care about how I present myself , hair is a mess, hair on my chin , hormonal imbalances just make me feel so masculine. \n\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tProcrastination and Productivity: Despite being driven and ambitious, I struggle with consistency. My focus and discipline seem to depend on my mood rather than a sustainable routine. I procrastinate on studying, cooking, and even self-care. I procrastinate on anything out there but my last minute bs can be so smooth sometimes no one would even know. Everything in my life is somewhat mood driven instead of being objective and goal driven and that makes it so unsustainable. I only get ready once a year, clean up once in few months , or even be happy once in a while. \n\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tClarity and Direction: I often feel like my days control me, not the other way around. I lack clarity in what I truly want for my health, relationships, career, and overall happiness. \n\nIt‚Äôs frustrating because I know I‚Äôm capable of so much more. If I had a dollar for every minute I‚Äôve wasted, I‚Äôd probably be rich by now. I want to raise my vibration‚Äîfrom operating in a place of lack to a mindset of abundance. I want to be a woman who:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tTakes care of herself‚Äîinside and out.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tDresses well, styles herself beautifully, and smells amazing.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tCreates a clean, organized, and inviting environment.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tEats nourishing food and feels physically healthy.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tStudies with focus, builds a great career, and grows financially.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tFinds love with someone who values and cherishes her.\n\nBut I feel stuck. The lack of discipline reflects a part of me I‚Äôm struggling to accept. While I dream of being a ‚Äúput-together‚Äù person, my laziness and procrastination keep getting in the way.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, which might play a role in this. However, I don‚Äôt want to use it as an excuse to stay where I am. I want to take control of my life, but I‚Äôm unsure how to get started and sustain positive changes.\n\nTo those of you who‚Äôve faced similar struggles or who‚Äôve built discipline and transformed your lives‚Äîwhat worked for you? How can I go from feeling like a passenger in my own life to confidently steering the wheel?\n\nAny tips, advice, or strategies to help me structure my life, develop good habits, and connect with my potential would mean the world to me.\n\nThank you for reading! I‚Äôm ready to hear your insights and take that first step.\n\n‚Äî A fellow work-in-progress :)",

About mid way through the year, I fell. Though I graduated high school with straight A‚Äôs in the 4th quarter. The college I had a half ride scholarship to shut down just as I graduated. This threw off everything. \n\nI tried my best to move past it. Accept it and keep pushing forward, but I wasn‚Äôt pushing, I was slipping, then falling. I had a friend I met in highschool who was with me for when I fell, she tried her best to help. But, even the friendship with her ended. I ended up finding myself in the lowest place I‚Äôve ever been. I lost my imagination, my love for writing and drawing. I was just in my bed all day, playing video games, watching porn and scrolling on social media. I used to talk to myself work out my problems, that voice in my head was gone, quieted out by something I still don‚Äôt know what. All there was was a void in my body, and a war between my heart, mind and soul. Scrolling endlessly on instagram reels. Deep into my depressive state I found a video, I can‚Äôt remember by who but it was positivity. A chill surged though my body as for the first time in a while it didn‚Äôt feel like a war was within me. Everything was calm, but a single voice, my own voice. And the same one that has been trying to guide me (as I now know) this whole time ‚Äúget up‚Äù was all it said and everything clicked. \n\nI still don‚Äôt know what it was about that video, but I began to craft a new instagram feed, one only for positivity, and I‚Äôve been working on cutting out porn. Recently I spent 2 weeks without it. And slowly I am cutting out social media. Every day I feel more me again. Looking in the mirror smile as my working out is starting to show a bit. Not much but show just enough to let you know progress is being made. It has been a long year for me. But, not one I didn‚Äôt learn from, I have most definitely learned a lot from every trial I have encountered this year. And in the end I believe it‚Äôs creating a better me. I am not finished with my improvements though. \n\nI know I can be more, and I can be better. And as November closes I look to December for a full detox of my dopamine and all other crutches I‚Äôve created over the year. Day by day, and more and more, I am growing proud of the man I‚Äôm becoming. And if this year has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that even the hardest of falls have something valuable to learn from. For Nov 30th I am going to use the day to reflect on everything, make the end of the year nothing but self improvement.",

Doesn't need to be in a relationship. In fact, get to know your friend's partners that they like. I don't feel like I was ready to be with a guy until I got to know my sister's boyfriend, who is a great guy and reminds me men don't all suck. I know it's probably annoying to hear but putting pressure on wanting a relationship makes it harder to make one work out, at least in my experience. \n\nAlso, which dating apps do you use? I met my partner through Facebook Dating. Most people don't even know FB has a dating app, and personally I like it. Because it's not super well known, the people on it are more likely to actually be looking for a partner and not just sex. The people using it are typically tired of other dating apps."

        "text": "I'm a 21-year-old male, turning 22 in a few days this December. About nine years ago, I had a few friends, but after moving to a new area, I wasn't allowed to go out and make new ones. The area wasn‚Äôt well-developed, and the people there were aggressive and toxic, according to my parents. Despite studying for three more years in the same school, my interactions with friends were limited to school hours. At home, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go out because I was the only child, and my parents were overly protective.\n\nI struggled with my studies and wasn‚Äôt good at sports either. Honestly, I feel like I don‚Äôt even measure up to \"below average\" in most things.\n\nNow, my parents expect me to achieve something significant in my career. But when I try to explain that I lacked social experiences because of their restrictions, they say things like, ‚ÄúDid we stop you from doing anything? We gave you everything you asked for.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not true. When I asked to go out with friends, they dismissed it, saying, ‚ÄúFriends these days are bad influences and will spoil you.‚Äù Whenever I shared my thoughts or ideas, they were brushed aside as dumb or unimportant, with someone older being prioritized over me.\n\nEven during financial hardships, when I offered to take up a part-time job to reduce their burden, they refused, not wanting me to \"get distracted.\" They didn‚Äôt teach me the essential skills to survive in this world. Whatever little I learned, I picked up from college friends during the limited time I spent with them.\n\nThere‚Äôs so much about my family‚Äôs dynamics that I can‚Äôt put into words here, but I don‚Äôt feel the kind of bond with my father that others seem to have. I don‚Äôt relate to posts or messages like, ‚ÄúMy father gave me everything he could.‚Äù Now, all they expect from me is to succeed, earn well, and settle down.\n\nAt this point, I find it hard to learn new things. My focus wavers, and I get easily distracted by everything happening around me.\n\nCurrently, I don‚Äôt have any friends, and there‚Äôs no communication with my old school or college friends either. For the past three months, there‚Äôs been this one girl who has been texting me on Instagram, but even she has been distant lately, not texting as much as before. I feel like whoever enters my life eventually leaves, maybe because I‚Äôm too available, boring, or for reasons I can‚Äôt figure out.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a challenging journey, and I‚Äôm trying to make sense of everything. I know I can‚Äôt change the past or the way I grew up, but I‚Äôm at a point where I want to take charge of my life. I‚Äôm aware of my struggles and limitations, but I also believe it‚Äôs not too late to grow, learn, and find my place in this world.\n\nI‚Äôm sharing this because I needed to let it out, and maybe someone else can relate to these feelings. If you‚Äôve been through something similar or have advice on how to navigate this phase, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Your suggestions or words of encouragement could mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n",

I have graduated from university and doing my residency soon i acknowledged i won‚Äôt be doing this as a career and i need to shift gears.When i was 16 i had pretty solid decision to become engineer like my father, he did well but didnt encourage me apparently he couldnt care less so i ended up making a big decision getting into medicine. My friends and family says that its not late and you can study again and get yourself your desired degree but i am already tired and even if i were to do that i would still be thinking why i didnt make a right decision 7 when i was applying for university.So now on i decided i will be ending my life when i get to 25 because i cant bear my thoughts as time passes they become more correct even though in the past when i used to have my first hesitations on this journey i wasnt sure and decided to match it and get a head to graduation and check out the situation afterwards.

It's been a traumatizing experience because the CEO bullied and insulted me in a way that shattered my self-esteem. I always excelled in school, in industry as an engineer and as a researcher in academia, I never saw myself as an incompetent person or a lazy worker. I have two engineering degrees and a masters in AI. It took me 6 months to clear some of my mental fog and recover from my fatigue/sleep deprivation of having a newborn. I was depressed for months on end, regretting moving abroad, regretting my career choices, my marriage, having a child while still building up my savings.  \n\nAfter my wife went back to work, l was the main child caretaker until baby started daycare. I couldn't practise programming or do anything intellectual. Since then, I've been practising my programming during the work week and taking online courses to get back into shape mentally. Yesterday I had a programming test for a job opportunity. Even though I knew how to solve it, I ran out of time before I could submit everything. My thinking was too slow and I had to pull myself back multiple times from going off on overthinking tangents. My fingers were hurting too from trying to type as fast as I could. Even today, I had 4 tasks to complete before daycare pickup and it looks like I'll only manage to do 2 of them. I don't know where the time went, I spent less than 30 minutes total on reddit/facebook/youtube this morning.\n\nPhysically, I'm out of shape. I'm always tired from household tasks. My sleep quality isn't the best. I'm stressed about money. I've deleted social media apps to quit doom scrolling and reading racist abuse as an immigrant in Canada. I am trying to eat healthier (hard to do on a poverty budget), avoid processed sugars and reduce my caffeine intake. \n\n  \nI need your advice on how improve myself. I've been reading online, I came across executive dysfunction, mild cognitive impairment and it's scaring me. How can I train myself to think faster in my particular case? What can I do to become more dynamic, sharp and gutsy?",

        "text": "I'm 21 years old, and I wanted to share my improvement. I've stopped watching cam girls and paying for OnlyFans. I realized, like a lot of people out there, that there is no point in paying for nudes and sexting. It's a waste of money. It's nice in the moment, but after you jerk off, you will feel pretty bad knowing you spent 40 or 50 dollars on something you could have just watched for free (Pornhub, XVideos). You could have spent that money on something else that you can use all the time, like a phone, computer, shoes, or whatever.\n\nI decided at a certain point that I would just stop. I canceled and deleted my accounts so I wouldn't be tempted to go back, and I think my life has improved. I started going to the gym, I bought a new MacBook, and I bought new sneakers. I'm about to get a new iPhone and other stuff that can help me. I also met a girl, and we started texting each other. I'm saving my money so I can get a Chevrolet Camaro (my dream car).\n\nOverall, this might not be a big deal in comparison to other problems, but I wanted to share my improvement with you. And before anyone comes at me, no, there isn't anything inherently wrong with watching porn, cam girls, OnlyFans, etc., and there isn't anything wrong with being a pornstar, cam girl, or OnlyFans model. It's your money, your life, and if it's between consenting adults, there isn't anything morally wrong about it. But if you want to quit, you can, and there isn't anything wrong with that either. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if it isn't a problem in your life and isn't getting in the way of your life, then you do you. But if you think it's a problem, then you should make a change. \n\nBut to the young men who do want to quit and are spending unnecessary amounts of money on porn, cam girls, and OnlyFans, please take a second and think with your head, not with your other head. There are so many other things you could use the money for, like food, clothes, shoes, electronics‚Äîhell, even¬†*Call of Duty*¬†and¬†*Fortnite*¬†might be a better investment. And if you still want to use it, take your time and maybe only spend money on it once a week or once a month.",

I always feel like I'm not enough and if he had the option in any situation, it wouldn't be me. He makes me feel like my presence and devotion to him isn't enough, and he constantly seeks validation and attention from others that don't even show them they care about him, yet I devote myself and mine isn't good enough, I'm always by his side through everything and I'm extremely loyal to a fault. I feel undervalued...\n\nAnd even with me having low self esteem.. I don't seek validation or attention from other men. \n\nFor example.. my mom recently passed away. I didn't want to go to any major gatherings for thanksgiving so I asked him if we can just cook at home this year. Instead of making the most of the day with me and enjoying my presence, he acted miserable all day and said he preferred to be with his family and made me feel like shit. He acted completely disatisfied with just doing one thanksgiving with me. (Fyi his family doesn't even contact him, he has to do all the work to maintain those relationships) And I'm here and try everyday but it seems like I'm only a burden and I'm not valued. He's even told me I'm not his priority.\n\nWhenever we are out and about, he's always eyeballing other women, he can't keep his eyes to himself, and then lies about it and I sit there crying feeling ugly. He wants to talk to other females he probably views as \"better than me\" personality and looks wise for his standards. \n\nHow do I break up with him and detach while living with him? This is going to be extremely heartbreaking because of how attached I am and don't know how to let go. I love hard. \n\nI need healthy ways to view myself without him determining my value. My value depends on him it seems and the way he acts towards me has brought my self esteem down to nothing. I want to improve.\n \nI'm also stuck in a lease with him for another year and I'm responsible for all the monthly payments even if I leave. My landlord won't work with me. How do I love myself more and love him less? ",

        "text": "When we met there was a lot of interest to date, but we eventually just decided to keep as friends as she told me she didn't want anything romantic as she still had feelings for her last guy.\n\nI retained feelings though and let them grow when i know i shouldn't of, I went to my friends to gather advice on what to do, and eventually when she was introduced to the group (We're streamers etc) I stopped, but went to one or two people mainly for advice. We had a disagreement earlier in the month where after her last guy fully left the picture I confessed that I liked her a week later, and she then asked that we give eachother space for a month, mutual friends that knew of this as I was not in a good state at all talked her out of it so we didn't talk for just a week.\n\nI tried my best after that to loose my feelings and I have, I still hold onto a small string of hope that one day we may give it another go as I do find her cute, and it's the closest I've come to dating anyone in like ten years. Though since we had the disagreement she's been fairly distant with me, she said it's just because she's busy but I can tell underneath that there's a reason she's pulled away from me as much as she had as it was starting to effect the friendship whether we are even friends or not. Two weeks ago she asked me to go on a walk with her and we did, which honestly went really well as we were open laughing joking and she even talked about potentially just doing a fwb situation go from there.\n\nThen she went back to being cold, and incredibly distant to the point she was really off with me even when we were playing games with friends, she did ask for advice on dating someone she mentioned off stream to someone 3 days after we met up which then put my head into a bit of a tailspin if it's me or not. I reach out on the 20th to ask if shes okay and she says that we'll speak at some point once she figures out what to say, then a week later on the 27th after I reached out she sent me a rather long message saying that we shouldn't talk through text as it's not something we should on this and that she wanted to talk about basically everything. I came on too fast, my feelings manifested for her which has also made friends as well as her uncomfortable, and that however did say that I'm doing better with this time apart as like I stated before I wanted to be her friend all month.\n\nI'm angry though it seems that its taken us ages to now get to this point, and I'm more angry the fact that it seems to of just been kept to the side up till now where now it's a problem, and I'm just overall angry that going to friends for advice has lead them to tell them how shit I've felt from this mixed situation with her.\n\nShe eneded the message saying she will need a lot of time to think but we are still friends, and that we will have a call at some point over it, so that's something. Though it's been about a month since we've been friends properly, I legitimately feel like saying to her when we do eventually talk that there is no friendship anymore but i don't know if thats just my anger talking again\n\nI just can't help but feel shit though, I know a lot of these insecurities stem from a mugging I had back in 2011 because as a result I ended up in hospital requiring surgery, for a very long time afterward I didn't really have friends, I didn't really seek help so I've come a long way since to better myself, but I also have small insecurity issues like this and I absolutely hate it. This is my first main friend group since then some I've known for the last three years.",

One way to feel ‚Äòless‚Äô lonely is to starve the idea of loneliness. As others have mentioned, get yourself busy with hobbies, read books, go for a walk, connect with nature, do a silly dance in the kitchen, tidy up your living space, treat yourself to a slightly different type of beverage or snack when you go out, and you will start noticing that you‚Äôre not lonely anymore as you‚Äôve made a friend out of yourself. In the grand scheme of things we only need our own company, everyone else will be attracted to our ‚Äògrounded‚Äô energy when they sense our lack of insecurity and when we‚Äôre showing up everyday with purpose in life‚Ä¶the right people will then connect meaningfully.

For an example, my coworker Drew. I know what state he was born in, what his parents do, his dogs name, that his mil is passed, his fil has dementia, and that he is getting a divorce. However, I don‚Äôt think he knows anything about apart from my name, face, and start time. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm new or anything, we‚Äôve been working together for over a year and have maybe conversations 10 minutes at a time.\n\nWhat I noticed is that anytime I try to talk about myself or insert tidbits, he quickly has to go or start slowly walking away. Or he just seems completely uninterested. \n\nNow here‚Äôs the thing, he isn‚Äôt the only one i noticed that does this. I have another coworker, Scooter, who will get me into these 15-30 minute conversations where he is telling me everything in their life. And it honestly just came to my attention that he doesn‚Äôt retain information about me.\n\nNo coincidence these are both men I‚Äôve mentioned, but here I‚Äôll give you an example of a woman doing this. I have a newer coworker, Samantha, who has literally asked nothing about me, but feels so comfortable telling me about why her daughter and husband don‚Äôt get  along.\n\nI can find multiple examples of this situation.\n\nI actually don‚Äôt mind when people open up to me, it allows me to learn about different walks of life, maybe learn something new. Especially if it‚Äôs older people, they will unintentionally give you wisdom that‚Äôs hard to come by. However, I think it‚Äôs a little disrespectful to not at least ask about other person in the conversation, or at least I feel disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, I do notice that I find it hard to talk about myself. I was bullied in school with the ol‚Äô ‚Äòpretend to be interested in what the weird girl likes to be funny‚Äô trick. So I do have an aversion to wanting to discuss my interests. And my parents would only want to find out things about my life to find a way to punish me or throw things back in my face. \n\nAnd also, it felt good to be acknowledged. Not use to attention, so someone just talking to me felt nice. And there is this little voyeuristic excitement I get from peeking into someone else‚Äôs life. I truly acknowledge that it is my fault. I just want to actually build relationships with people that isn‚Äôt one-sided. Not just exchanging life stories, but also talk about other things. Like hobbies, politics, maybe even celebrity gossip. \n\nAny feedback?",

And trust me, it‚Äôs probably one of my favorite ways to bring clarity, peace, and wellbeing in my life. You‚Äôll come out feeling like a new person.\n\nSo here‚Äôs what I recommend as a first detox: block out two days that are relatively stress free (could be a weekend, or even just a few days where work is light). Wake up without your phone, no TV, no music. Just listen to your thoughts, and be aware of your surroundings, and have a quiet morning.\n\nDuring the day, go about your day normally, but avoid overstimulation. Overstimulation comes in many forms: junk food, being in busy places, and social media. Be wary of what you eat and where you decide to spend your time. If you need help avoiding social media, get a tool that forces you to be mindful before you open your apps. I set up one that forces me to chat with an AI before unlocking (superhappy ai), which has helped a lot.\n\nMost importantly, avoiding overstimulation doesn‚Äôt mean being bored all day. A good first dopamine detox is one planned with relaxing self care activities like meditating, a nice walk with a good friend, reading, and more.\n\nAfter two days, your dopamine baseline should be reset! Feel free to carry this into the rest of your week, or don‚Äôt! Regardless, you should notice that you are more energized and happy, and best of all that you find joy out of the little things more often. By doing this detox, you‚Äôre investing in yourself. So please, take this as your sign to try it out :)",

I had a conversation with my best friend, and she pointed out that I often say yes to things even when I‚Äôm not comfortable with them. She made me realize that if I just said ‚Äúno,‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt let people take over my pace. If I just said a certain thing about what I'm not comfortable with, they wouldn't have perceived me as a comfortable being. And in turn, they wouldn't have expected a lot from me. It's not their fault either since I allowed the other person to be comfortable. And it has happened even last year, and I've realised my own mistake in this matter.\n\nI have very little energy, and it takes a lot out of me to meet new people and connect with them. My pace is slower than others, and I‚Äôm totally okay not talking to my childhood friends for months. In fact, even when I don't, they are quite okay with it. They used to get upset at first but then they realised about my pace. But I often say yes to new people who I meet face to face, and when their pace is too fast for me, I end up feeling drained. They want to meet me right off the bat, engage with me in every activities they do, force me to go out often, etc.\n\nWhat I realized is that I wasn‚Äôt really having conversations with them. I was just matching their energy. I‚Äôd completely ignore how I was feeling just to make them comfortable. When my friend pointed this out, it was like a reality check. No wonder I felt like my space was being attacked‚Äîit was because I wasn‚Äôt protecting it in the first place.\n\nSo I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this lately.

To learn how to ride that bike, to learn how to register my needs and what I was really feeling.\n\nSo to do this, I had to learn to check in with myself much more often and learn to be honest with myself. I didn‚Äôt necessarily have to even set a boundary yet in this stage of my learning process.\n\nI was so far in at the time, that I would believe I was excited or high energy etc but I just felt pressured to match their energy. So I had to first recognize that habit of mine‚Äîthe pattern of obfuscating my true feelings. I had to learn to flag when I lied to myself, when I wasn‚Äôt being honest with myself."

        "text": "Today was a busy day even without work. I started my morning off with doing a few things I wanted to get done and then iced my foot. I made a list of ways I want to do better to start my morning off. Ways to improve and what to do more of going forward. I started to head out later than I wanted. As I was leaving my grandfather hinted at wanting help moving rocks for my mom around her flower bed to move some mats to not get caught in the snowblower. After that I headed out and first got something to eat. I deposited money at the bank and then tried on different shoes for a while. I tried on one kind but many different pairs and widths to get the best feel. Nothing felt perfect but a 12 wide felt best for having some space. It felt like a little but too much space but I was swimming in 13 shoes and 12 felt day too tight on the toe box. The wides at least were wider there but felt like the length increased as well in the heel. I wish it could be perfect but it will have to do. It seems these shoes have decent reviews, there is a Black Friday sale, and I get a coupon for money off. It was the best deal for these shoes and they can be grabbed soon. I went to a few stores and then headed to the gym. I had a leg day and I pushed everywhere I could. My hamstrings were screaming and I felt good. I even had a small interaction with a gym crush of mine. I know it's silly to have one of those but I would have never interacted with her normally but she asked me if I was planning to use the machine since my backpack was right next to it. I told her I wasn't and thanked her. Something small but I don't know it felt weird and I am terrible at even small interactions with people I find attractive. Besides that here was my workout:\n\nSeated leg press:\nReps of 8 6 6 6 with weight typically increasing by 5 each time to be 60, 65, 75 or 80 and 80 pounds\n\nNote: Forgot if I did 75 or 80 so did another set at 80\n\nNote: Did 35 40 45 at the end of each set only doing one leg 4 times each but 3 at 45\n\nSeated leg curl:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 75 80 and 85 pounds\n\nNote: Struggled to get to 4\n\nHip adduction:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 95 100 and 110\n\nLeg extension:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 80 85 and 90 pounds\n\n15 minutes of the stair stepper. I upped how fast it went after 9 minutes from 44 steps per minute to 60.\n\nAfter the gym I went to a few other places for groceries and then grabbed food to end it off. I got food to watch my favorite streamer. I tried to coordinate with my mom to see if she wanted me to grab her something but the stars didn't align. I think she wants to try the place but she went out with a friend. The night was pretty much over after that. It was a nice day of running around and looking at things. The workout was great and I ate well. A perfect day to enjoy.\n\nSBIST was the awesome feeling I got when working out again. I decided to push even further once again and my goodness did it feel good. My legs were killing me and they will surely feel tired tomorrow. My hamstrings handled so much weight that I'm proud of them for what they achieved. Not too shabby for a guy who had never been to a gym before this journey. I like going here and slowly but surely adopting the culture. Working harder and harder towards a goal where I can feel beautiful on the outside and maybe even slowly build a better me on the inside. A me I need to let flourish. \n\nTomorrow the plan is for some Thanksgiving festivities but this one is just my mom and me. She wanted to make dinner and I will not be using a holiday cheat meal for it. That was used on the family Thanksgiving so I will be counting calories and I will get to see what that is like for a holiday. Besides that the plan is to stay in because the gum closes very early and there are rumors for a lot of snowfall. I want to work on my tabs and look at some Black Friday deals.

                "body": "First is figure out what you want to do (AKA the goal) and once you figure out what you want then need to create a plan of action to get said goal (AKA a system).  A system is a means to a end so in this case the system is the means to get to the goal that you want to achieve.  Ask yourself why you want to achieve this goal.\n\nSo lets make a simple example:\n\nGoal: Walk 3000 steps a day\n\nHow to achieve:\n\n1. Get items need to achieve the goal a pedometer device or use an app.  If you need other devices to help achieve the goal either procure them or figure out other means.\n2. Figure out where you can fit this in your day.  If you have a job that keeps you mobile all day it should be easier to supplement extra steps before work or after work.  If you have a desk job then work on it when you can during say during that time say such as on break.\n3. Celebrate your goals when you achieve them and accept setbacks occur but don't get discouraged by them.\n\nSecond is make the goal something you can realistically achieve.  If say you want to be a millionaire by the end of next year but only make $30,000 a year and have no investments or savings its not going to happen no matter how much you want it to happen.  Give yourself a timeline if its something you want to achieve or keep it unending if that works better.\n\nThird make some check point smaller goals.  This is  important when you have a big goal so that you don't get discouraged because it takes time to get to that goal and it may not feel like you are making progress.  So lets go back to the step example.\n\nGoal: 10,000 steps a day\n\nWhat I can currently do: 2000 steps a day\n\nCheckpoint 1: 2500 steps\n\nCheckpoint 2: 3500 steps\n\nCheckpoint 3: 5000 steps\n\nCheckpoint 4: 7000 steps\n\nFinal goal : 10000 steps\n\nAs you can see the we still have our final goal but we have smaller goals that we can work on so that we always have something to strive for along the way.\n\nFourth this is helpful but either write it on some paper or get some kind of reusable surface such as a dry erase board.  Write your goals and where you currently are.  Its one thing to say mentally I'm at x place along my goal.  It is another to actually see it in some physical form.  I find that having the physical form gives me the motivation to keep working towards the goal and lets me visualize where I am on the journey of accomplishing the goal."

I had long labia which I was ashamed of as I never knew that vulvas were all so different. I thought masterbation had caused me to look different and unlovable.

This surgery is barbaric and should be illegal. I just needed to be taught I was normal but instead doctors completely amputated my labia and they stole my sensation from me and have replaced it with pain and discomfort. They cut my frenulum below my clit which is constantly sore and they have turned a pleasurable sensation into a burning pain. How do I carry on with my life I keep really trying but it is always there, it haunts me, the life I could have had without that procedure. üò≠ I'm 31 now. It's wrecked every aspect of my life.\n\nHow do I find the will to keep going when I'm haunted by not being able to have intimate relationships and experiences that I could have had if someone had just educated me properly.

I sought validation from the opposite sex, even if they were attached; something I'm deeply ashamed of now.\n\nUnable to regulate my emotions I got into lots of arguments, fights, and embarrassing public situations where I had no regard for public decorum or other people full stop. \n\nI've left a string of jobs and mentors most of whom took a chance on me and I let them down. Usually in the most unprofessional way.\n\nAfter receiving my diagnosis mid 20s I've spent a LOT of money on therapy and coaching, and have really done a lot of inner work to rectify my mistakes (and will continue to do the inner work).\n\nDespite my rocky start, I'm highly capable and constantly on the cusp of achieving success, but I self sabotage because I'm so scared to be seen. I'm fearful that with any modicum of success might come a tidal wave of people who (rightly) want to tear me down because the person I was. I'm so embarrassed and it hasn't even happened yet.\n\nI understand that all actions come with consequences and I'm not trying to sweep my past behaviours under the rug, but surely it's not a life worth living if I'm going to continue to keep myself small for fear of being 'outed' as an awful person?\n\nI'm really not sure how to move past this, I want to be accountable for my actions, but I also don't want to have to air my dirty laundry to explain why I was so awful. \n\nAdvice?",

A lot of this is trauma and I'm really trying to work on it with therapy and such, but you know, therapy time is limited and can only do so much, without external work. \n\nI am a housebound and mostly bedbound Disabled person and I really want to work on my ability to feel comfortable with being alone and be okay with not having to check in with people constantly and make sure that they're doing okay. This is really difficult when I spend a lot of my days on the internet, trying to feel like I have some sort of connection and sort of community, while also fighting off boredom. While I don't exactly want to be a hermit, I don't know exactly how else to put it into words.\n\nI want to be able to focus a lot more on introspection, spending time on my own, feeling okay with being alone, and if that means less time on the internet, that's cool and an added benefit. I've been focusing on journaling and spirituality a lot more, but am looking for other ideas. Unfortunately, reading books is an issue for me, and while I do enjoy a good audiobook, I struggle with my memory to recall several hours worth of content, as I tend to like to read fiction.\n\nBut I continue to find struggles with this need to, (and I say this as a person with OCD) compulsively check in with others, make sure they're doing okay, and send things that I feel these people will enjoy and we can connect with, as a person who most days doesn't see anyone. Does anyone have any advice, suggestions, etc.? ",

        "text": "\n*Logical thinking means when a person tries to think logically irrespective of how logical they are*.\n\nOur emotions and thoughts work in the same direction. Thoughts shift fast. Emotions shift slower. That's why immediately after break up you will feel attached but if you constantly hate them for breaking up you will no longer attached to them. Emotions are against logic because they turn around slowly but they are not really against your logical brain. Give them few months they will catch up.\n\nGetting rids of most of our thoughts allow us to control emotions better since having too many thoughts will not allow the emotions to shift in a direction we want to. Emotions will be confused by the wide range of thoughts.\n\nGetting rid of identification with body, mind, society, parents, family, religion, gender allow us to get rid of most of our thoughts. Most of our thoughts revolve around these. That's why in meditation we give up these identities and our thoughts slow down.\n\nMost meditation apps doesn't mention this idea of getting rid of identification with everything which is why it doesn't work for many people. Ever since I got rid of identification I became more confident from a shy boy, turned from a good boy getting bullied to a arrogant type with no care about anyone. You can become like this if you give up your identification. Stop being the good boy/girl and your depression, anxiety will go away. \n\nJust to be clear, I followed meditation and spirituality to have my own path ignoring others and I don't agree with traditions that suggests being lazy is some sin or all that bullshit meant to control us. There are many crazy hermits in ancient Chinese Taoism (Not sure though , that's what I think based in the media portrayals) or ancient Hinduism in India (Aghoris are spiritual Hedonists who deviate from society) that didn't care about society and their ethics were as good as Ryomen Sukuna in JJK. So not everyone follows religion or spiritual believe in morality. Some religions tend to be like satanism. Based on what I know Eastern religions had all forms of ideals that you witness in modern age like atheism, agnosticism, hedonism and also devotion, morality etc. But kings and rulers will obviously filter out some of those to maintain order. It's your responsibility to seek out truth than believe what is prevalent in society.",

Think about the beauty of nature, the power of music and movies, the love you have towards other people and animals, and everything about yourself that you do love.\n\nIt's a challenging road, but it's the best possible investment you can make.

But eventually, I started feeling really awful and couldn't ignore it anymore, so I had no choice but to face my fear and get that test done.\n\nEven though I still haven't gotten the results back and I'm still not feeling well, I'm so proud of myself for overcoming my fear after three long years of avoiding the doctor. I wanted to share my story not only to celebrate my own victory, but also to show y'all that no matter how tough it may seem, you can overcome your fears too. I believe each and every one of y'all reading this can conquer your fears just like I did.\n\nI also wanna stress the importance of not ignoring your health problems, no matter how small they may seem. Don't wait around thinking they'll just go away on their own. Go see a doctor and get checked out, 'cause if there is something wrong, it's better to catch it early and start treatment before it's too late. So don't hesitate, take care of yourselves and face your fears head on. You got this!",

We know that the things that once excited us or brought a sense of contentment no longer achieve the desired effect. We know that our conversations have grown silent, few & far between, and dissonant‚Äì leaving us feeling all at once incompetent and disconnected. And we know that the connection to ourselves feels severed. \n\nWe medicate and it helps, a few of the unwanted side effects have seemingly gone away. But it leaves us with a keen sense of confusion.. if I‚Äôm better.. why don‚Äôt I *feel* better? Whether one has chosen to medicate or not, the truth remains, all of these symptoms were never an attack upon your psyche but rather your psyches attempt at flashing a warning light. \n\nPerhaps there is truly something wrong here. An imbalance in the brain, a lack of nutrients in the diet, too few calories burned each day, not enough time with family. Or perhaps even from the start all of these things were symptoms that started within the mind..\n\n‚ÄúYour life is half over and what do you have to show for it?

How to calm down? \n\nBackground:\n\nIm almost finished completing my BS/MS in environmental sustainability. I love talking about it because I find it very interesting and am happy that a lot of the misconceptions I had have proven to be wrong. Ex: I used to think sustainability and business was a trade-off, but businesses make more profit from being sustainable due to reduced resource allocation and public support. \n\nBasically, when some of these topics come up at home or among friends, I literally sit up immediately and my muscles will clench just so I don‚Äôt interject. I got to a point where I wait for others to speak but I still find myself trying to say something when it might still be too early and it sounds like im trying to cut someone off. \n\nWhen I finally get a chance to speak, sometimes it goes really well and the convo goes deeper, but other times I‚Äôve noticed that the dynamic changes once I start talking. I try to keep it short, but because there are so many bases to cover, I‚Äôll end up saying 4-5 sentences at once. Today, someone in the convo started doing other things while I was talking. Once I realized I‚Äôve lost people, I‚Äôll tell a joke and they‚Äôll laugh and re-engage, but I still feel shamed about it after. I think a bunch of things are happening: 1, im too eager and people can tell. 2, I say too much. 3, im using college terminology, and 4 I‚Äôve done so much research on it that people don‚Äôt bother disagreeing with me. It seems like even if I leave room for conversation, others just process but don‚Äôt engage. \n\nThe solution seems to just allow everyone else to speak and not say anything, which would be nice in its own way to observe. But how do I get my excitement under control? And how do I let go of this feeling that I have to reveal this important information to people? Sometimes people tell me with amazement that I‚Äôve really changed their perspective in life and other times it feels like im trying too hard to ‚Äúenlighten‚Äù which is icky. And it‚Äôs not a matter of reading the crowd because I never bring these things up unless it‚Äôs already being spoken about. ",

In fact, in my case, not only I get too excited, but louder as well :')\n\nSomething I have been trying to do actively.\n1. Asked all of my friends to remind me whenever this happens and I start getting too excited about some topic \n2. I started making notes of what are such topics and once such topics are about to come in any conversations, try to consciously remind myself, to stay calm\n3. Still if I get too excited, and I feel like I have a lot to speak, I start speaking as if giving bullet points, something like, so first of all ...., then after making first point see people's reaction and then only proceed to next if it interests them. Otherwise simply move on by saying, \"Damn, I feel like I can talk whole day, but let's skip it for now\"\n\nAll in all, this just boils down to proactive listening and observing consciously when this happens, so there is a heads up for your brain to be in control. \n\nHope this helps. Let me know if something else that works for you, might help me as well :)"

        "text": "I've got so many thoughts running through my head right now and I apologize if this isn't the right place for them. I'm terrible at understanding the right place for my content. 90 % of all posts I've ever made on Reddit have been shut down due to being put in the wrong sub.\n\nAnyhow, I'm a chronic nihilist. I don't believe in *anything* related to self-help via the power of the mind. I have such a hard time believing that *any* activity or mental exercise can make permanent change.\n\nFor example, I have a friend who got into meditation like a full-fledged bhuddist at 30 and, in everyone's eyes, changed considerably. What I believe is that this was her moment of finding what she were always meant to be doing. She didn't \"change\", she finally became *herself*. Meditation didn't do magic. It was just a fish finding the ocean.\n\nNow, i assume that these are rather controversial statements in a sub like this, and that's exactly why I'm making them here. I need help to believe in something.\n\nWhere does a super cynical, hard-core, scientific-minded, self-professed realist genius (idiot) turn to get help when nothing sticks? And before you ask \"Have you even tried?\":\n\nDozens if books, meditation camp, affirmations camp, six different group therapies, several cognitive behavioral therapies, several acceptance and commitment therapies, circlings, reiki, deep tantra, relational therapy, connecting with the inner child and crying for five days straight only to get hard as stone again after that, and I don't even remember the name of the rest of this hippie stuff. And last but not least, 15 long years of 15 different psychologists, two senior ones of which have outright stated that I'm the toughest nut that they've ever attempted cracking.\n\nSome of these felt good. Some of them were fun. Some were fucking traumatizing. But they didn't make any *change*. I didn't find me. I don't feel calmer, more certain, more connected, more in-tune with my feelings, more grateful, or any of these other things that the people who host these events keep advertising.\n\nCould this be from the lack of faith alone? But if faith is a necessary component in change, that would mean that it's all placebo. But that also requires humility that I don't possess. Placebo surely only works for those feeble enough to be fooled. Actual change would have to mean rewiring of neurology. The only surefire way that I've heard of to do that is to hit your head real hard and get amnesia.\n\nIs change a temporary illusion? Or just a missing component that were always dormant until you woke it? How can anything ever affect your inside that your inside didn't welcome because it always wanted it anyway?",

I've Never had an addiction or problem with it, I just decided to try it and see what impact it might have on my life. Obviously alcohol is poison and cutting it out has resulted in some serious improvements in my life, most noticeably being increased testosterone, less brain fog, and better results in the gym. I feel great, I'm proud of myself, and I don't want to go back to drinking besides maybe a few on special occasions. \n\nHowever, my social life and lately my mental health has suffered immensely from this. I'm a senior in college and every social event involves drinking in some way. My friends all want to go out to bars, play drinking games, or booze on NFL Sunday. I used to enjoy these activities but I'm realizing that they're not very fun when you're sober, *especially* when you're the only sober one there. \n\nI genuinely tried to enjoy going out sober, but its just not fun for me as an introvert. Maybe I'm just negative, but I now just see it as loud, hot, ego-filled rooms where people talk about nothing and get wasted. When I'm drunk this environment becomes enjoyable, but I just can't stand going out anymore. I've stopped going out and I'm losing touch with my friends. \n\nI am conflicted on so many levels. Societal pressures to drink and go out, the possibility of losing my friends, FOMO, and the fact that my girlfriend now goes out without me, are all reasons that are making me think about picking up that whiskey bottle. At the same time, I firmly believe drinking is horrible for you and I want to stand true to myself and treat my body well. \n\nI used to believe \"you shouldn't need alcohol to have fun,\" but it's hard to think that when everyone in my life drinks alcohol for fun... fun that willingly missing out on. \n\nMany of you are probably going to respond \"You just need to find new friends\" but its not so simple for a few reasons\n\n* Making friends is easier said than done\n* I'm a senior in college\n* Pretty much everybody drinks so its just the same problem again with new friends \n* A lot of people that don't drink are weird\n\n I'm feeling very lost and don't want to waste my last year of college or lose my friends. It's sad to think that drinking is the answer to those things but honestly that's how I've been feeling as of late and don't know what to do.",

I've donated plasma, donating plasma/ blood reminds me no matter how bad I've hurt people. I hold within me the capacity to give life. My life no matter how horrible, I can still help others. Nobody is worthless. There is always something bigger at play, thinking you're the worst or the best is 100 percent ego.\n\nYou're not as ugly as you think you are. I promise that a lot more goes into attractiveness than outer looks. Someone with a good sense of humor, that's honest and compassionate goes a long way. Develop an authentic personality and that's attractive. Someone worth loving \n\nRecognize we all have darkness within us. Each of us in some form or capacity has darkness or traditionally speaking shadow traits. That's okay, get to know your shadow side it's not all bad. For instance a good liar, tends to also be highly creative and a  good storyteller. Channel darker energy into more productive things that can help people. This will help you live yourself more.\n\nUnderstand you're a highly conditioned individual. You didn't make you. Once you understand you better your on some level more responsible for your behavior but know that you're nothing that people have told you. That's a projection onto you. Their illusion of what they think you are. I promise for every bad thing you think about yourself I can give you two qualities that make you lovable. Most of our general hate for hate or dislike of ourselves comes from other people's views of themselves. Even the worst of the worst have a place in the world and deserving of loving themselves. On some level we're all connected.We are them and they US.\n\nDo I love myself. Yes I do. I am slowly working on myself. Sometimes even when I am not, I don't know the big picture. Like I said before something larger is at play, I may be a piece of a huger picture I don't see yet. But yes ultimately we all deserve love. I suppose I do. I help where I can, and I am learning to better myself slowly."

But it's that I want to be cautious of doing it as yes I can call ssi about my problem with my mom and boom problem is solved it's about what will happen next like will they stop supporting me as since my mom had to \"convince\" them to get my ssi back or what will happen next you know, also I'm not sure if I can just call them myself since I have a feeling the people who work at ssi are like hawks the observe everything I do and behave and they see I'm smart amd they be like \"OK we got to remove this guy he not what his mom told us\" also I have savings like $2k and it's even like $4k since my mom took all my savings of $2k and even is taking 90% of my income so but she said she will give it back to me with and extra $2k when she gets her money from her lawyer from a lawsuit against a company but we haven't heard from them yet.\n\n   So guys I'll be honest I feel like I'm out of ideas in know I smart guy or I like to think a good head on my shoulders and I try to be resorceful with my money and stuff but I just feel like I'm at a corner with no other ideas and having a timer counting down like a boom and feel like im fucked like a duck, like do you guys have a time whe were pin to the wall and you have no options to get out of a stick situation well that what I'm feeling man.\n  \n  At this point guys I don't know what to do next man I'm trying to fix my life and turn it for the better but fuck man I out of ideas at this point.\n    ",

        "text": "I feel like shit right now. I left my job today because I honestly fucked up. I made a mistake within the company and it was bad. I did love my job at my first but when it came to having no growth within the company, I started to spiral into depression. \n\nI did really well with my job, no complaints at all. Everyone was pretty much nice and the job pays well. Was the work alot? Not really. Probably a dream job for someone who isn't looking for much. For me however, I wanted to do more and move up in the career. I did ask my boss constantly to help me get there and give me more work load but she never did. She wasn't the best boss when it came to training but was chill. After being with the company for a year, I decided to ask my boss for a career advancement and she was happy to help. Then she made an announcement next week that she is leaving.\n\nAfter she left, I basically started hating the job. Felt like I didn't have anyone to lean on to for help with my career advancement. I did have other managers but felt like they were so busy with their own stuff that I think they wouldn't have benefitted me. I started looking for new jobs while this was going on and I made a mistake yesterday that led me to a suspension. I deserved it but I decided there and then that I resigned for the mistake.\n\nI 100% deserved it. Now I am jobless. My best friend and husband were not as mad. They told me I hated the job anyway and that I deserved better. It's not that leaving the job was making me depressed, it's just I felt like I lost myself in the job. I used to have more passion into my work but what I did was got too complacent and feared of moving on.  Also, I think that I made my General Manager disappointed in me. I didn't hate him and we hsd a good relationship, I just hope he doesn't see me as a horrible worker. I did send out an email to him apologizing. I probably won't get a response but at least I tried to make peace.\n\nAnyway, my Thanksgiving week will be a horrible week. It has only been 16 hours that I feel like shit still and hate myself. I am scared of the unknown. What if I can't find another job? What if my new job is a shitshow? So many thoughts in my head. I wish I could reverse time and leave the right way. Thank yoh for people reading this.",

I moved out to a new city for a new job a couple months ago and my motivation has gone through the roof, confidence, ability to get things done. Even my habits have improved (I have ADHD so that's a big deal for me!). Since I've moved, I haven't been able to go out as much, and subsequently I haven't really been drinking. \n\nIt never occured to me the correlation between not drinking and self improvement until now. I went out with friends the other night and it was only the second time I've had alcohol this month. The next day I had a hell of a hangover, probably because I drank the amounts I would normally drink without considering that not drinking for a while would mean it has more of an effect. The day after that, I still felt rough. Yesterday (three days after I went out) I had no motivation, I continued to eat junk food and I didn't leave the house. Today, finally, I've felt better again. I've gone out, hit my steps goal and done a shop of healthy foods, I've eaten well (hit my fibre and protein goals), and I've studied, drank water blah blah. This is what I've been doing for a couple of weeks with no issues. I finally feel back to my \"good self\" and the anxiety I'd experienced the past few days has gone down.\n\nIt occured to me that those feelings (laziness, unmotivated, hungry for junk, not sticking to habits), is how I spend much of the past couple of years. And I genuinely think going out once a week was the reason I never felt like truly \"good\". It may just be a coincidence but I am starting to think alcohol has more negative effects on day to day life, even after a few days, than I once thought.\n\nCan anyone relate?

It‚Äôs been about 8 months now and I was doing pretty okay recently, settling in, getting a decent job. But this week I just could not stop thinking about the girl I dated before I moved back. She was really awesome but it didn‚Äôt work out because I had to move back. But like now I can‚Äôt help but check her Instagram all day this week? That‚Äôs so weird and not like me.\n\nAnd my ex. We loved each other a lot but same reason, 3 years ago when I decided to move it didn‚Äôt work and we had an on and off thing going on until we decided to end it. Now she‚Äôs engaged (I‚Äôve known this for a year) and like today I just couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her when I wasn‚Äôt thinking about the other girl and checked out her Facebook. This is terrible, and I know it‚Äôs just gonna make me struggle to move on more now (although up until recently I thought I was pretty good and moved on but I guess not??) \n\nI need like. A hobby. Or friend. But I pretty broke right now and all of my current friends have either moved or have zero time to hang. I‚Äôm in the process of trying to make new friends but in the meantime, any advice on some cheap things I can do to help? This is concerning. ",

        "text": "Today was a freaking fun day. I woke up starving and had a big breakfast with sauce included. I then headed off to work after getting ready and icing my foot. I was almost even late due to me mismanaging my time and then my grandfather asking for help at a terrible time. Since people were grabbing their turkeys for the big day, it was busy. I helped a lot of customers, stayed positive, and made some pretty decent tips with one woman giving me nine dollars. I cleaned our vacuum sealer which really needed it and felt good with how good it looked. I had a lot of fun talking to my coworkers and my boss even gave me some delicious cranberry sauce. I asked for one to be put aside for me to buy, and the boss gave it to me for free when giving me money towards working. During work I also thought about how I want to make a big Christmas dinner since I couldn't afford one on Thanksgiving and it honestly is so much work. If I am financially fit and the time management is good, then I would love to make one with Thanksgiving sides but maybe a meat such as turkey or corned beef which is my favorite. It's just an idea for now. I got home and then worked on a bunch of other stuff for myself such as deleting tabs, grooming my cat, cleaning the litter, and I organized my medicine bag. At some point my grandfather called me in the middle of the night to ask if he could check my antifreeze. I swear this man has a thing with timings. I didn't mind though because he was trying to help and we checked it together. I was good and it still had its freezing properties. We checked my mom's too and it was good but my grandfather didn't like how it looked. As I was going back in the house, I slipped on the steps which had freezed a bit. Of course while checking the antifreeze something that has freezed over a bit causes me to bruise my shin. It's like the world is telling me to slow down. I also forgot to mention that I didn't attend the gym once again because my toe still hurts greatly. Not nearly as much as the day before but still enough to not go. It's okay though, I will get my gains soon. I think the shin thing will not cause any more delay and by tomorrow I should be able to go. The day was very good but I made one mistake and that was having too many calories. I had about 400 over or 200 hundred over my 10% leniency since I try to stay under 2200 to 2000. I wasn't really paying attention as hard as I usually do and eating so little the previous day caused me to just not think about it as much. It is upsetting to think about but I can't beat myself up for it too much. I think I have been doing so incredible and working so hard. I just need to tell myself to do better tomorrow. To keep on track again and again. One bad out of the many I've been having shouldn't cause me to stop my progress. It's a learning curve to tell me to pay attention more after this. Keep doing better and better. You got this. Enjoy your cheat day tomorrow since you have been working for it but then after that keep going for under 2k every day. I already wanted to start working even harder because I don't want my body to plateau so this gives me even more inspiration to do it. I can do better and I will. Here is what I ate:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n1 slice of toast - 100 calories (3 g protein)\n\n32 g of peanut butter - 190 calories (7 g protein)\n\n¬Ω cup chocolate milk - 70 calories (6.5 g protein)\n\n38 g of Protein + pasta - ~130 calories (~6.9 g protein)\n\n~39 g of sausage (hard to tell with sauce clinging to it so I took some grams off) - ~120 calories (~8.2 g protein)\n\n~188 g of meatball - ~235 calories (~15.1 g protein) \n\n124 g of sauce (based it off Rao's Marinara and added some calories but it was homemade) - ~125 calories (~2 g protein)\n\nLunch:\n\nWork Dessert of Oreo cream pie (22 grams) - 75 calories (~1 g protein)\n\n41 g of cheese - ~160 calories (~10.3 g protein)\n\n120 of deli turkey - ~110 calories (~21.4 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\nPeanut butter sandwich crackers - 190 calories (4 g protein)\n\n131 g of peppers - ~45 calories (~1.5 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n30 g of Protein + pasta - ~105 calories (~5.4 g protein)\n\n~71 g of sausage (hard to tell with sauce clinging to it so I took some grams off) - ~220 calories (~14.9 g protein)\n\n~99 g of meatball - ~125 calories (~8 g protein) \n\n99 g of sauce (based it off Rao's Marinara and added some calories but it was homemade) - ~100 calories (~1.6 g protein)\n\n13 g of grated parmesan cheese - ~50 calories (~5.2 g protein)\n\nDessert:\n\nLeftover candy - 100 calories\n\nSoda of the Week - 170 calories\n\nSBIST was the feeling of being busy at work helping customers. It wasn't a constant kind of busy but it was much more than the usual few days. I love constantly moving and doing stuff. Having something to do and feeling I am doing it well feels amazing. It was a moving and grooving kind of day and I loved every second of it. Talking to customers, wishing them a happy holiday, and then some people being really nice and tipping is great. I love that feeling of movement while working and will probably one day miss it with my next job. \n\nTomorrow I have work off and I plan on running some errands and having my cheat day. I already have a plan for what I want. I want to visit a few stores and deposit money at the bank as well. My car insurance payment is coming up and I just want that money looking good in the bank. I also want to look at shoes at maybe a few stores or just one store depending on what I find tonight and tomorrow morning. I also will try to return to the gym and further ice my injury. Either way tomorrow will be a busy day even without work and I hope I get called on soon for more work after Turkey Day. Thank you my conjurers of the moves and the grooves. You make me feel like I am constantly moving and boogying to get things done.\n",

I'm good at communicating online yet I rarely ever reply to my peers. People tend to tell me to raise my voice but I still can't look at anyone in the eye. This anxiety started as early as kindergarten and especially at preschool, and although I managed to push it down during high school, the realization I've been getting that nothing had actually changed or improved makes me sick. I wasn't even bullied that much in the first place, I'm just scared, insecure, and nervous and I don't want to repeat what had happened to me in third grade where I was so traumatized during introduction that I forgot everything that had happened on that whole grade.\n\nI had my fourth heavy breakdown this monthn, earlier I had to cry in private and skipped classes because everything is eating me up. I look like a creep at public.\n\nMy friends are worried and my family is angry for how much my grades keep dropping drastically. Money is a problem so I can't go to any therapist. I tried to ask other forums for advice but I can't carry them out for the lack of courage. I really need to change or to erase this anxiety  ASAP or else my mother will disown me. I'm having suicidal thoughts right now as I'm writing, I know I'm probably overreacting but I really want to stop being like this. Someone or anyone,please. I'll be thankful for any response. Sorry for my bad English.....",

I used to have such terrible social anxiety I couldn‚Äôt even look people in the eye and they would ask me to raise my voice as well. And yes, social anxiety tends to formed when one faces a difficult or unpleasant experience. First thing is you need to raise your self esteem. Figure out what the source is, what is your reaction. What r u exactly afraid of, rejection? Judgement? Etc. then figure out how you‚Äôre exactly defining that reaction and why. Remember though that not everyone is like whoever you experienced that unpleasant encounter or whatever that situation was. And practice makes perfect. Practice in front of a mirror or through little daily interactions like a cashier at a grocery store. Just little steps at a time. But biggest thing is, how do YOU see yourself? And is it actually true? Most people don‚Äôt see you the way you see yourself, and most people care more for themselves than they do you tbh."

But unfortunately, I think looks were too embedded into me and growing up in an all male household placed this expectation of how I should look. Even being 15 years old and talking to my dad about being flat chested and him a few weeks later saying to me, \"I couldn't help but to see down your shirt in the car and if you wanted implants when you get older I understand.\" Or something along those lines. I struggled with my weight too, but never was taught to accept myself but try to change it instead. He'd get me an exercise bike, gym memberships. I didn't learn to love these things.\n\nSo I'm an adult now and I have been looking at fat transfer for breast augmentation since a teenager. I feel guilty for wanting this. I make decent money, it won't put us in a deep hole but is it a waste of money? I'm in therapy. I'm trying to fix myself, trying to be a better parent for my child than I had growing up. We might need the money some day though. I'm just tired of how much this has affected half of my life now, how much I've restricted what I wear because I don't feel proportional. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry if this shouldn't be here. I just need advice. ",

I also became desperate in my mid 20s and make some stupid and costly mistakes that I‚Äôm still trying to bounce back from. Just breathe and live man don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. No one knows what the hell they are doing. Figure out what you want to do career wise, go get into a job, maybe a trade, try different jobs. If one isn‚Äôt for you apply for another one while working and keep doing that until you find something you feel where you click at or are good at. As a man the more you know something and how good you are at something, the more useful in society you will be. Life is harsh for men because we aren‚Äôt valuable based on our looks like women are, we have to be capable at doing things. That‚Äôs what makes us men. Also I wouldn‚Äôt advise missing out on the partying but I would go all in getting hammered and doing stupid stuff either. Have a balance. Learn to talk to women now because if you don‚Äôt know you will struggle later (trust me on this) but I guess the best piece of advice is just keep going and keep living. Don‚Äôt blow your money save as much as you can. Live within your means. Once you get enough saved up invest alittle in stocks (that‚Äôs a whole nother conversation) but the sooner you start investing even like a 401 k or Roth account the better you will set yourself up for your future. But like I said live. Live your life. Hit the gym. Learn a skill. Learn an instrument. Learn new hobbies. Learn to fight like Marshal arts. Face your fears. Ask out a hot chick once a week to face your fears with women. Rejection is good for the man‚Äôs soul lol üòÇ it hurts but you‚Äôll get over it. Get that heartbreak out of the way. Easier to get a heartbreak now then when you‚Äôre my age for the first time. Learn to help people in whatever way you can. There is too many selfish people in the world and I‚Äôve learned one of the reasons for living is simply helping others live too. Be kind to others and yourself. Find a church. I believe In God but I‚Äôm not going to tell you what to believe. Hope this helps"

A year has passed, clearly there‚Äôs still emotional work you haven‚Äôt dealt with about the breakup. I suggest a therapist to work through your feelings especially cause it‚Äôs been a year. Healing is not linear my friend. I would suggest you get back on the dating scene after you deal with these feelings as to not use the next person and see that your ex is not the only one out there.

Since then I‚Äôve been able to shift my mindset to sorta moving with the flow of the evening, not pressuring myself to have all the fun I can squeeze into that timeframe, and listening to when my body gets tired, and it‚Äôs actually made my post-work time more enjoyable even though it‚Äôs a bit shorter than it used to be.

        "text": "Hi. I've decided to post here because life is getting the better of me lately and I have no idea how to combat it. I've feel like I'm doing everything I can right now, but it all feels too overwhelming.\n\nI'm 20, nearly 21 years old. I got out of sixth form two years ago, and I took a gap year because I was at the lowest point in my life. A year later, I picked up a software development apprenticeship. In January, I'll be finishing this, and I'll have to decide what to do afterwards. I think I want to go to university. I want to make friends. I want to live independently for a while.\n\nFor a while, I thought I wanted to study art. I'm no good at art, really. I picked it up fairly recently, not having done it at GCSE or A Level (UK Secondary School qualifications) and already there are expectations on me because I need to produce a portfolio with 15-20 pieces by June (I've got about 3 or 4 currently). Today, however, I realised that even though I'm only so early into my art journey I'm already having expectations placed upon me and it's stressing me out. Now, I'm starting to question if I even like the subject at all. It wouldn't be the first time my brain has pretended to like something just to satisy others' demands. Game design looks pretty fun, and incorporates some of the elements I like from both art and my current job, but that requires a seperate portfolio, and there's almost no way I could do one before the June cutoff, meaning I wouldn't be able to go to uni until September 2026. I'm tired of waiting. I want to go now. I hate seeing my school friends finish up their courses while I'm still stuck at home. I don't want to waste another year, especially in this failing UK economy. I want to stop comparing myself to others but how can I do this when society breeds this type of mindset? \n\nTo be honest, I don't trust that I'll be able to deal with whatever comes my way, work wise. My ADHD and autism heavily affects my ability to be consistent with a learning plan, and I get exhausted easily (could be blood related, getting that checked). I feel like sixth form has mentally destroyed me, and demolished my thirst for learning. What am I supposed to do? I'm at a loss right now. Any engagement is helpful, because I really want to speak to someone about this. Thank you.",

I haven't worked since the beginning of October and have spent my adult life either in college (finished two semesters), working, unemployed, or in college and working.\n\nI don't get along with my family very well and I'm tired of living in Indiana so I want to move out, but I know that's a silly idea when I don't have to pay rent here.\n\nIt's been a year since I was last in college and my family is practically begging me to go back. They're also paying for my entire tuition. As stupid as it sounds, I have no motivation to go back and I have not idea what to study.\n\nI have no motivation to do anything in life. I've tried meds but the problem is I hate working and no hobby is interesting or fun. I'm just not meant to enjoy life (cue people telling me I'm wrong about this).\n\nMy only dream is to live where I don't have to speak English at all. I love learning languages, but because I live in Indiana I have no contact with any outside of the internet. I want to move abroad, but it's too hard to get a work visa so my next best option is Puerto Rico, but the economy is terrible there. I wouldn't mind making as little as they make, but from what I've heard it's hard to get a job there without connections (or even with connections). I could also live on the Mexican border, but people would just speak to me in English because I don't look like the stereotypical Mexican which would be incredibly frustrating. I want to feel like the past few years I've spent on Spanish have actually been useful for something.\n\nThe option that appeals to me the most is to live in a car and work full-time and spend as little as possible. I'd do that for 3-6 months and then I'd go to Latin America until my savings ran out and then repeat. I'd obviously have to work entry level jobs for $16/hr or less, but if it means I can live my life in another language for most of the year I don't care. The problem with this is I would feel bad doing it because Latin Americans can't do the same because they make way less than I do.\n\nIs the best option for me to move out of my parents' and work for a few months and then life off of savings in Latin America until I run out and repeat? If not, what do you suggest I do?",

So I looked for an running buddy/accountability partner, someone who would run with me. A year or so later, I was still looking for a running partner and I had run a total of 0.00 miles.  I kept telling myself \"If only I could find a running buddy.....\".\n\nLOL\n\nA few month later I realized I was full of shit, and I was making myself excuses. So I started running Mon, Wed, Fri after work 6 PM, 5K every night, starting at my place.\n\nTalked to a few friends and they all said that they would love to join me, if only it would be at the beach instead of where I was running.\n\nSure deal, we'll run at the beach. Changed the venue and told everyone who was interested. Nobody came.\n\n\"Oh 6PM is too late, if only we could run at 5PM....\" so I changed my work schedule and started running at 5PM, told the interested parties. Nobody showed up.\n\n\"Oh if only was Tuesday or Thursday.\" So I started running every day, Monday to Friday.  Invited the interested people, nobody showed up.\n\n\"Oh the weekdays are hard, if only was on weekends.\" So I started running also on Sunday morning. Nobody showed up.\n\n\"Oh on Sunday I have church, if only was on Saturday.\" So I started running also on Saturday. Nobody showed up.\n\nTrue story.\n\nRunning was OK, but I wanted more, so I started lifting at the gym.  Within a few months, I could see some difference. Wihin a year my body was quite different. My friends were intrigued and wanted to join me. I told them when I was working our and where, told them to just show up and we could workout together; nobody showed up. Ever.\n\nAsk around, I am not a unicorn, this happens every time.\n\nWanna do it? Do it.\n\nAccountability partners are nice, but they are just excuses.\n\nYMMV"

        "text": "## Introduction\nImprovement, while generally positive, is sometimes counterproductive. Sometimes, improvement is the enemy of progress, and can delay success, or even lead to failure.\nThis is especially true when reaching the point where improvements lead to diminishing returns.\n\nIt's well known that striving for perfection is an antipattern. The problem is that it's not always obvious that you are falling into this trap.\n\n> Perfect is the enemy of good ‚Äî Voltaire\n\nThe truth is that it's much easier to keep iterating to \"perfection\" instead of facing those underlying issues head-on. It's a coping mechanism, a way to avoid dealing with the real source of the problem. Luckily, it's avoidable, if you pay attention to the signs and if are honest with yourself.\n\n## Perfectionism is the Symptom of a Disease \nPerfectionism is the symptom of a disease. I'm not kidding.\n\nSo-called \"perfectionists\" will spend hours tweaking small details, never feeling satisfied with the end result. In reality, perfectionism is often a symptom of deeper insecurities or anxieties. Fears.\n\n> Perfectionism is the illusion that all details matter equally ‚Äî Tiago Forte\n\nThe truth is that it's much easier to keep iterating to \"perfection\" instead of facing those underlying issues head-on. It's a coping mechanism, a way to avoid dealing with the real source of the problem. Luckily, it's avoidable, if you pay attention to the signs and if are honest with yourself.\n\n## Signs that Perfectionism is Holding you Back \nPerfectionism can manifest in various ways, often subtle enough to go unnoticed until they significantly impact your productivity, life, and success. Common signs include chronic procrastination, as the fear of imperfection leads to task avoidance. You may find yourself unable to complete any important project or task because you set (consciously or not) unrealistically high standards. This leads to disappointment, frustration, and in severe cases, burnout. The inability to celebrate achievements, no matter how significant, is another telltale sign, as you might tend to focus on what could have been better, instead of appreciating what has been accomplished. Recognizing these signs is the first step towards breaking free from this \"illness\".\n\nI have had such tendencies for decades now. And I know exactly where it came from: insecurities, low self-esteem, and Impostor syndrome. Those have developed through constant criticism I received from my dad when I was a teenager, and because I was extremely shy. In a way, this pushed me forward in life. It forced me to try and remain \"perfect\" in the eyes of everyone. I had a visceral fear of being judged, even though there was not much to be afraid of. I needed to stay \"invisible\" in a way, and the only way I could achieve that was by doing everything as perfectly as I could, always remaining \"in control\", no matter how hard and exhausting it was. No wonder I came so close to a severe burnout. More recently, through my startup project failure, I've also realized how damaging it had become for me. That's also why I'm writing this today; to share my own experience of this illness.\n\nHere are some signs that you are falling into the trap of perfectionism:\n\n- You have trouble completing tasks (duh)\n- You keep finding ways to improve or tweak things\n- You are obsessing over details for days\n- You never feel satisfied about the end result\n- You have trouble accepting something as \"good enough\"\n- You procrastinate frequently\n- You regularly switch between tasks\n- You wait for the \"perfect\" timing or conditions to get started\n- You are stuck in Analysis paralysis, trying to make the \"best\" choice\n- You're overly critical of yourself and others\n- You set impossibly high standards\n- You fear taking the wrong decision or making the wrong move\n- You keep pushing yourself beyond reasonable limits\n- You feel stressed or burned out\n- You never allow yourself to relax\n- You don't celebrate your progress and achievements\n- You think in terms of absolutes. Either something is perfect, or it is a total failure\n- You have trouble seeing shades of gray and partial successes\n- You know you have already missed opportunities by delaying delivery\n- You have hit a point of diminishing return. You know that each further improvement will yield less and less benefit\n- You are constantly comparing yourself to others\n\n> Perfectionism is when the subscouscious overvalues the unimportant subtasks in order to postpone task completion and hence the verification of our performance\n\nThis can lead to a cycle where we feel overwhelmed by seemingly endless smaller tasks, never reaching a point where we can truly assess our accomplishments and move forward with confidence.\n\n## Nobody is a \"real\" Perfectionist \nNobody is a perfectionist. We like telling ourselves and others that we are but deep down, it's just fear masquerading in fancy clothes. Perfectionism is a shield we use to protect ourselves from criticism, failure, success, and the uncomfortable reality that nothing is perfect. When we act like perfectionists, we're just avoiding the real and meaningful work. The work that we're \"scared\" about\n\nYes, you might get criticized. Yes, you might fail. Yes, you might actually succeed. But you won't know unless you stop iterating, and start delivering. Your best work is the work that others can see and/or benefit from, not the one you're endlessly iterating over.\n\n## Shipping is crucial for learning \nMany people, myself included, miss many opportunities because they are scared to tackle the work they're actually afraid of. Don't be one of those. You need to learn to say \"stop\", and accept that \"this will do\". You need to accept that \"this is good enough\". More often than not, better can come later.\n\nProgress is a better measure than perfection. It shows that we are learning, growing, and striving to be better versions of ourselves. Strive for excellence, not for an unattainable ideal.\n\n> Perfectionism keeps us from making mistakes but also from making progress ‚Äî Tiago Forte\n\nLearn to ship. Face the criticism if it comes, and be ready to improve based on actual feedback, rather than based on your fears. Shipping is crucial. Actual progress can only come from actually releasing your product, service, or work. Many projects never see the light of day because creators are constantly tweaking and improving without ever launching. Again, I'm writing this based on my own experience. I worked for two whole years (an insane amount of life time) on a startup project that nobody will ever use. That project die because we mistakenly pursued the illusion of perfection.\n\n## Learn to embrace imperfection \nEmbrace imperfection. Accept that your first iteration may not be perfect. Consider each piece of work as a starting point. Unless if you create rockets for the NASA, your first \"version\" doesn't have to be perfect. Just look at SpaceX. How many rockets did they fail to launch? Did it stop them? No. Yes, it could have, but it didn't.\n\nOne thing is for sure. If they kept delaying their launches, their company would be long gone by now. Instead of trying to design the perfect thing before launching it, they pushed the button, watched it explode, and learned from their mistakes.\n\n> Normalize imperfection. The best things in life are rough around the edges\n\n## Seek feedback, not perfection \nReal-world feedback is invaluable. You can't predict how people will react. Whether it's your customers, your boss, your colleagues, your partner, etc. Seek feedback instead of perfection.\n\nWhile quality is of course important, there's often a point of diminishing returns where further improvements delay release without meaningful benefits.\n\n> Anytime you resist perfection and share your work, no matter the feedback, you advance in some way. You either receive praise (win) or criticism you can learn from (also a win). Either way improvement is inevitable. Don't let perfection paralyze you into anonymity ‚Äî Tiago Forte\n\nMark the task as \"Done\". Tell others it's done. Hit \"publish\". Share your work. Don't add needless delays. Delays just push the feedback further down the road, and actually prevent you from making progress. Get your work out there. Do it now.\n\nOvercome your fear of criticism. Put your ego aside for a minute. Consider that feedback is invaluable. It's necessary for progress, growth, and success.\n\nThe great thing about feedback is that it enables iterating based on reality, instead of made-up stories.\n\n## How to avoid Perfectionism \nHere are a few actionable strategies to help you break free from the perfectionism trap:\n\nBe mindful:\n\n- Stay in the present moment\n- Be aware of perfectionist thoughts and tendencies as they arise\n\nReframe your thinking:\n\n- Recognize that perfection is often subjective/unattainable, and develop a \"good enough\" mindset\n- Be willing to try new things without fear of failure\n- Focus on effort and progress rather than flawless outcomes. Instead of \"This must be perfect,\" try \"This is the best I can do right now\"\n- View challenges as opportunities to learn and improve. Replace \"What if I fail?\" with \"What can I learn from this?\"\n- Shift from \"I should have done better\" to \"I did my best with what I knew at the time, and with the resources I had available\"\n\nSet realistic goals and expectations:\n\n- Break big projects into smaller, manageable tasks\n- Set time limits for tasks to avoid endless tweaking\n- Define what \"good enough\" looks like for each task\n- Focus on progress, not perfection\n\nPrioritize and focus:\n\n- Identify the most important/urgent tasks\n- Allocate your time and energy accordingly\n- Let go of less critical details\n\nChallenge your assumptions:\n\n- Question whether your high standards are truly necessary\n- Consider if others have the same expectations you do\n- Evaluate if perfectionism is actually helping or hindering your goals\n\nTake action despite doubts:\n\n- Start before you feel fully ready or prepared\n- Focus on taking the first step, however small\n- Use the \"2-minute rule\" to overcome procrastination\n- Remind yourself that done is better than perfect\n\nSet boundaries:\n\n- Learn to say no to unnecessary tasks or commitments, so that you can focus your energy\n- Recognize when you're overextending yourself\n\nSeek feedback and outside perspectives:\n\n- Ask others for input to gain new insights\n- Be open to constructive criticism\n- Don't take feedback personally. Use it as a tool for growth\n- Remember that others are often less critical than we are of ourselves\n\nPractice self-compassion (i.e., love yourself)\n\n- Recognize that mistakes and imperfections are normal and human\n- Talk to yourself kindly, as you would a friend\n- Celebrate small wins and incremental improvements\n- Let go of self-criticism and self-induced negativity\n\nLearn from others:\n\n- Study how successful people in your field handle imperfection\n- Observe how others balance quality with efficiency\n- Seek mentors who can provide perspective and guidance\n\nYou should also consider Journaling and Periodic reviews. Those are both extremely valuable, and can help you look more objectively at your own plans and actions. That being said, if you are honest with yourself, you usually know when you are busy splitting hairs.\n\nOver time, you might have developed severe perfectionist tendencies, but it doesn't mean you can't act differently in the future. Try these strategies for yourself, and you should find a healthier balance, without getting stuck in an endless cycle of tweaking and second-guessing. Focus on continuous improvement.\n\n> Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection ‚Äî Mark Twain\n\nConclusion \nNext time you find yourself caught in the perfectionist trap, remember this:\n\n> Your enemy isn't mediocrity, it's inaction\n\nUltimately, the key is to find the right balance between improvement and action. Continuous improvement is valuable, but not at the expense of progress. Learn to recognize when better becomes the enemy of good, and you'll be more effective in achieving your goals.\n\nRemember that the goal is not perfection, but rather creating value and solving problems. Sometimes, done is better than perfect. Recognizing when you've reached \"good enough\" is a crucial skill for both professional and personal projects.\n\nSo go ahead. Take that first step, share that imperfect draft, launch that minimum viable product. The path to excellence is paved with many iterations, not a single flawless attempt.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss this concept further or have any specific questions about it, I'd be happy to explore that. Let me know if you need any clarification or additional information!\n\nFinally, I'll leave you with this wonderful quote:\n\n> Pobody's nerfect ‚Äî Pam, The Office, Season 8\n",

Later on, I caught him discussing it with my other cousins, but since we were drinking and having a good time I didn't want to confront them or make a big deal out of it... but it did bother me, and for more reasons than just him speaking behind my back. \n\nFirstly, people have asked me this question before and I've just never known how to articulate my response (mostly out of embarrassment), but I'll try to right now and perhaps even try to get some advice from you guys.\n\nMost recently, a lot of people that I meet always tell me that I'm either very handsome or very beautiful, even though I'm a guy. I've had this compliment from both girls and guys - straight and not. Before, I was always insecure about the way that I looked, but I went through a *\"glow-up\"* where I cut off my ragged dreads and started working out, so now I understand why people compliment me by saying this. Even during my last year of High School, I started getting a lot more attention and compliments, especially from girls (and even from girls that I had crushes on). \n\nDuring my last year of High School, girls would stare at me a lot more, smile nervously when I was near them, and they were even more willing to engage with me in conversations. In regards to the latter, I'd even say that guys were like this because I started getting a lot more friends and getting invited to a lot more social events than I had before. In clubs, I've even had girls try to talk to me, kiss me, and even buy me drinks. And yet, despite all of these changes and attention, I still have never had a girlfriend. \n\nI stay on my University's campus and I get a lot of leering looks from girls, but I'm too nervous and anxious to actually talk to them. You must understand that before my *\"glow-up\"*, I never used to get attention from girls, and I would even get brutally rejected by them, so now I just don't know how to talk to girls or handle a situation where one tries to talk to me or likes me. All the situations where I've had a girl actually kiss me were always initiated by them, and some of those moments were always in the context of a social event like a club or a festival, etc. During these events, I was always mostly drunk and a lot more confident than I usually am, so I could handle those moments a lot better than when I was sober. When I'm sober, I usually get very nervous talking to or even approaching girls.  \n\nRecently, I've had girls who stuck around and tried to start relationships with me, but they always failed rather quickly because I wasn't very responsive to them. Some girls are bolder than others so they'll try to get my number and hang out with me, and they'll even try to talk to me whenever they see me, but my anxiety gets the better of me and I always pull back from them. I always try to get away or end the relationship before it even starts because I don't even know what to do in those situations. It's like I panic and try to find a way to sabotage it before it goes too far. Sometimes I'll take the girl's number, chat with her for a little bit, and then I'll ghost her if she starts talking about going out to the movies or anything like that. I don't know why I get so afraid and anxious. I think maybe I'm afraid of commitment or to be someone's boyfriend. I'm mostly afraid of coming across as weird (which was always the thing girls would say when they rejected me in the past) or failing them in some other way. \n\nI don't really like myself a lot, I will admit that. I think some of the insults that were made against me in my past sting a little more at this point in my life because they feel like they've actually come true. People used to call me \"weird\", \"stupid\" or a \"loser\", and now I feel like I'm actually all of those things because of the way that my life has actually turned out. I'm 24 and in my sixth year of a law degree that should've taken me 4 years to finish. I've also watched all of my friends surpass me by every metric in life. Some of them are already interns in law firms or getting their doctorates, and some of them even have girlfriends and money and are on their way to getting houses. And I'm far behind where they are. I keep failing at Uni, I still stay at my mom's house, and I can't even act right enough to court a girl. I definitely *feel* like a loser and a failure in my life, and what's worse is that that feeling is what makes me even more unable to feel confident talking to girls. \n\nSo to have my brother (or any of my family members and friends) be so concerned about me not having a girlfriend actually cuts deep into my insecurities and the inadequacies that I already feel about myself. It's not necessarily the idea of him thinking that I'm gay that bothers me, it is the fact that he thinks that my failure to get a girlfriend must mean that there is something wrong with me (not to say that there's anything wrong with being gay, but I realize that that's the way that he perceives it).  When I caught him discussing this with my cousins, they were basically cackling and snorting about it. Like I said, it cut deep into my insecurities of feeling like a loser and a failure.   \n\nI'm not gay btw, I don't like guys like that and I genuinely like women. It's just that I get super nervous and anxious around them, and it's probably because of the things that are happening in my life currently. I've also never been in a relationship before, and girls never used to like me in that way in the past, so I genuinely don't know what to do when a girl tries to even engage me in that way. People who see me can never truly understand this and they always think that it's a guise for the fact that I'm closeted or weird. But I'm not. I'm just going through a lot, and it stings more when my family is the one ridiculing me about this sort of stuff. \n\nNow, I don't think that I could ever tell anyone this stuff face-to-face because I'd feel like a *wus*, but that is what's going on inside. I just don't know what to do about any of this stuff, so I thought I could write it down and ask for some advice. \n\nWhat should I do? How do I get over the anxiety of talking to girls? Should I address my brother (and other siblings)? What would I say?ü§î  \n",

                "body": "My experience is they are a bunch of BS. It may work for some and there may be some scientific processes that really induce change in ones mind...\n\nBut in my experience, if youre for example very insecure and just repeat \"Im confident and stand up for myself!\", it will change nothing... At best, it gives you the illusion something changed until its tested in a real life situation, where it crumbles like a cookie. \n\nWhat really helped me was starting to develop courage. Basically understanding that if you want to go from highly insecure to confident, from self-hatred to self-love, it is an active process that takes a lot of time/energy and also sucks on most parts of the way to get there. \n\nI was controlled by fears and feelings of unworthiness. You wont change that by just reciting affirmations, especially not if you then keep doing the same things and dont actively change your behaviour. \n\nThe only way for me was to \"grow a pair of balls\", so to speak. It was either i face these fears and problems fully or i will always be that way, stuck in the same cycle. So naturally, the process involved a lot of setbacks, errors, even more negative emotions... It often felt shitty and it often was. It was anything but easy and it was anything but fun.\n\n  \nI believe affirmations are the epitome of the false notion thats often spread in the self-help-community:\" Use this hack and you'll be the guy!\" / \"Do these 3 steps and you will be the next model on the vanity fair cover!\" / \"Recite these affirmations and you will be the most confident person anywhere you go!\". \n\n  \nThe most important point is: You cant lie to yourself. It has to be rooted in reality.\n\nSimple example: You can tell yourself all day youre are jacked like Schwarzenegger. You may even be so good at deluding yourself that you start to believe it... As long as you dont look into a mirror, ever. As soon as you do, the delusion will dissolve completely.\n\nOr: You can say \"i want to be as jacked as Schwarzenegger\" and then go the hard way to get there... Eating right, exercising, everything. One day, youre really jacked as F... And you will feel that way, look that way, remember all the hours of \"putting in the work\" and so on. So there will be no doubt youre jacked and the feedback from yourself and others will confirm that. Your mind will believe you because it knows its the truth. You didnt persuade it into some fantasy, you did the real thing.\n\n  \nI think the same goes for most mental developments and mentality changes. The real problem is that people always want a solution that excludes the hard parts, which in most cases is realistically not possible at all. You either do it or dont get the benefits you dream of. 99% of the time, there is no hack, no easy way and no simple solution."

        "text": "Today was a boring day but pretty good. Work was very slow since people thought we were closed since the store is usually closed on this day. I got out of the house and set out decently early for myself. I did my job and tried to find things to do and help out with. One of my coworkers got to the job who I found her mug for and gave me money towards it. I tried to refuse it but then we both ended up getting emotional over people we had lost close to us and she told me she would kick my ass if I didn't take it. I told her it would go towards tires and my safety and I appreciate the money. After work I debated very hard for the gym but ended up not going due to the bruised pinky toe. I began my day limping at work but got used to the discomfort. I didn't want to further the injury so I went against going. I don't have good or comfortable shoes right now and I have an injury which is pressed during any workout I do. I was also on my feet all day so it worsened it. When I got home, I iced it and that helped a lot. I had a lot of things to work on and try to do this night. To the point where I laid down in bed and instantly passed out. I had plans to have a nice spaghetti dinner but it got late. I promise I was not trying to skip out by eating less calories. I was very ready for a great dinner when I just went to bed for a few minutes and fell asleep just like that. Next time I'll force myself to eat a bit earlier while working so that doesn't happen. Calories are needed for energy and I want some to help me for thinking and existing. It was a silly mistake and I know as I finish writing this that I'll be having a good breakfast. A breakfast of champions involving sauce. Either way here is the little I ate today:\n\nLunch/Snack:\n\n1 pierogi - ~65 calories (2 g protein)\n\n9 grams of pepperoni - ~40 calories (~1.8 g protein)\n\n41 g of cheese - ~160 calories (~10.3 g protein)\n\n95 g of deli turkey - ~85 calories (~17 g protein)\n\n28 g of stuffing - ~100 calories (~1 - 2 g protein)\n\n56 g of meatloaf - ~100 calories (~8.3 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\nMidday Dessert:\n\nLeftover candy - 100 calories\n\nSBIST was the feeling of having a good day. I honestly didn't have anything too exciting happen. I had a nice conversation with my brother about different things. I had a decent conversation with some coworkers. It was just honestly a good day. I think sometimes we have to reflect on the matter some days won't be too exciting. We have to appreciate the boring ones too and I had a happy day. The boring good made it something sort of beautiful. We have to find the wins and the beauty as we can. \n\nTomorrow my day will be busy because the meat shop is very busy on Turkey Day. People want meals, turkeys, and sides as they can get them. I love busy days because I can br constantly doing something. Since I don't help process meat anymore, I rely on the front being busy. I hope it goes this way because I need more to do. I want to go to the gym but I'm not pressing my foot further if my pinky toe is still messed up. I actually miss going knowing I'm pushing my body. And tomorrow I will put more food into my body! Thank you my conjurers of the low energy. Sometimes those kind of rookie numbers just happen. \n",

Doesn't matter how much or little I sleep I'm beyond tired all the time & I sleep most of the day cus... Why tf not? Getting up early only makes the day longer & therefore more boring. Social media is also boring asf too I open Instagram & then just close it again after 5 seconds, I try playing games but I get instantly bored of them & can't be bothered trying new ones, I bought a few but about 5 mins latet I've put em away again cus I lose or something, I have no hobbies because I'm not good at anything & being bad at things used to kill my interest pretty much instantly in whatever but I don't feel interested in anything anymore. I'm bored to high hell in school but somehow not as much as at home. Usually I can't wait to go home when Im at school cus I'm so bored, I suck at talking BC I have no friends for many years now & my delusional parents never let me go outside. I've tried talking to people but my voice is terrible, I'm also quite certain there's a girl in my class that likes me but when I talk to her my voice makes me wanna ahh cus it sounds so lifeless & awkward compared to what my inner voice sounds like. I also don't like my face cus it looks angry, my eyes are black & my hair receded at my temple area so i always wear a hat to hide that. How do I stop this? ",

        "text": "Something I recently noticed is that I \"obsess\" over things a lot more commonly than most other people. \n\nI'll watch a show or movie, and I'll be obsessed with everything related to it. My dream is now the main characters dream, and I cannot experience happiness unless it is the exact scenario that the main character experiences their happiness in. \n\nThis lasts for about 1.5 weeks, after which I grow \"disgusted\" with the plot and it loses all value. Same thing with music - and same thing with video games and other hobbies/ambitious ideas. \n\nMy obsession is extremely powerful - I set a high standard for myself; to become whoever the main character became. Show me a romantic movie (La La Land for example) and I'll listen to it's soundtrack for days without listening to anything else - and I'll want to become Ryan Gosling - and I'll value myself lower as I'm not at that standard. \n\nI'm currently working on heightening my emotional intelligence, as well as treating myself better constantly, so I can kind of \"stay grounded\" though experiences that impact me greatly. \n\nBut I've mostly just stopped watching movies, shows, or started on hobbies that might impact me in that way - I'm scared of going through the obsessions again because I get nostalgic, then sad, then feel incomplete and unproductive as a result.\n\n**I have a few questions for people who have had this happen to them:** \n\n\\- What was the best solution that worked for you? \n\n\\- Were you able to solve this so you can enjoy everything on a less heightened basis? \n\n\\- Any tips for me to do objectively that can help me grow my emotional intelligence?\n\n\\- I've heard that therapy is the best way to get emotional intelligence - is this something I should look into?\n\n\\----------\n\nSo far, what I've started doing to fix this: \n\n\\- Journaling; I write down answers to \"why do you think this\" over an over again, and I get to the conclusion that I'm not happy with myself, which gives me a step up to insist I AM happy with myself. \n\n\\- Meditating; I try to free my mind from the obsession, it works 50-50 because a lot of the time it just pops back up. \n\n\\- Being honest with others; I've started telling this to others, which is how I found out this wasn't normal in the first place. I've also started expressing my values a lot more strictly - if you aren't respectful, prompt, and communicative, I will address it - and it's genuinely helped me a lot in knowing myself and respecting what I respect about myself.\n\n\\- Taking productive action; I've tried to take a balanced approach to working out, reading, and working on my hobbies - where I can't work on them too much but can't abandon them altogether - in order to keep all parts of \"myself\" visible and in the present. \n\n\\- Treating myself; I'll spend money on myself to make me happier, and I usually try to associate some sort of unique sentiment to what I buy. I'll tell myself \"this is just like a movie\" and I try to kind of see myself as an actor doing something with a purpose (basically 3rd person awareness). \n\n\\------------\n\n**TL;DR:** I get obsessed with any event that impacts me emotionally; what's worked for people who were/are in the same position?

        "text": "Modern life makes us drift further and further away from ourselves.\n\nNature and we‚Äîtogether, we form one entity, and the more we disconnect from her, the worse we perform in life. Sounds a bit vague, right? Let's clarify.\n\n# 1. Nature is a free therapist\n\nWhen we walk through forests, along the seaside, across dunes, or up in the mountains, we resolve the conflicts swirling in our minds. Nowadays, we accumulate mental clutter without ever truly decluttering. One distraction leads to another until our heads are full of problems, and our dopamine sources run dry. \n\nFriends and family often offer biased advice because they don‚Äôt want to hurt us. Instead, take a walk now and then. Connect with your origins, and you might be amazed at the great things that unfold.\n\n# 2. Nature has seasons, and so do we\n\nWomen have a 30-day cycle, while men have a one-day cycle. Men experience a full range of mood shifts within a day, whereas women experience theirs over a month. As we age, our hormone levels naturally change, altering what matters to us. What seemed insignificant 10 years ago might mean the world today‚Äîand vice versa. \n\nAcknowledge that each phase of life is finite, and make the most of it. All of us transition. Resisting change creates unnecessary stress and headaches. Go with the flow, and you‚Äôll be surprised at how easy life can become.\n\n# 3. Like the board game Monopoly, nature always gives you starting capital\n\nFor some, nature‚Äôs gifts are obvious‚Äîbeauty, a tall frame, or a wealthy family. For others, these gifts might be hidden, waiting to be discovered. Don‚Äôt despair in the search for your gift. Keep exploring and enjoy the journey. Sooner or later, you‚Äôll encounter hints leading you to your unique strengths. Follow those hints relentlessly.\n\n# 4. Nature always connects what belongs together\n\nTrust the process. Whatever happens in your life‚Äîbe it a person, job, or experience‚Äîhappens for a reason. If you‚Äôre not ready or a fit for a particular person or job, your paths will eventually diverge. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial to define who you want to be instead of letting others define you. Once you‚Äôre clear about who you want to be, you‚Äôll attract new people, opportunities, and experiences that align with your ideal. Don‚Äôt drift aimlessly‚Äîtake charge, and let nature handle the rest.\n\n# 5. Get as comfortable as possible with death\n\nFear-based decision-making, aimlessly drifting through life, and being intolerant of yourself and others often stem from a fear of death. The more comfortable you become with the idea of dying, the better your quality of life will be. According to Terror Management Theory, confronting your mortality can help you let go of materialism and foster more meaningful relationships. Personally, I deeply admire people who acknowledged, that nobody of us will get out here alive.",

        "text": "In 2021 I gave up on everything, I was planning on taking my life after a series of failures left me unemployed and directionless, but I didn‚Äôt have the heart to put my cat through rehoming and losing me forever, especially when she stayed close to me during that time. So all I had the energy for was to just think, think about everything, all the way back to the beginning when my life first fell apart when I was 5 and my mom burned the skin off my legs. I realized that I felt so empty, because I never lived for myself, I always lived according to the expectations set around me, everytime I expressed myself I got pushed down for it, so I kept myself in a box. I asked myself what I‚Äôd do if things were perfect and everything went the way it needed to, who I‚Äôd be. I wanted to be an artist, I wanted to be free to be myself, whatever that is, and I wanted to keep to myself and not try to befriend everyone or trust everyone since I developed a problem with rejection. So I decided that I‚Äôll give myself one more chance, and if I still feel the same way after living life as myself, then I‚Äôll go through with it.\n\nSo I spent the last few years improving parts of myself, one step at a time. At first it felt like I was living life with a gun pointed to my head, but then‚Ä¶ I started seeing the beauty of being alive, I started learning what relaxes me and being able to develop a clear mind to think through negative feelings clearly, and bit by bit, I took note of an issue, tracked the source, and tackled it, becoming an entirely different person over that time. Even while developing serious chronic health issues, my mind is still clear, and that gun? I don‚Äôt feel it anymore. When I almost broke down a few months ago because things were falling apart again, I almost immediately shifted gears to calmly deal with it to a point that it was scary. I don‚Äôt know how I managed to do it, but I conquered my thoughts and I‚Äôm on track towards making my goals happen, even if it‚Äôs going to take a while realistically.\n\nThe problem is though, I just started not liking a lot of people. The more I worked on myself, the more the toxic traits in others began to scream out louder. I can‚Äôt relate to anyone anymore because people around my age feels really immature and older people are more closed-minded. I can‚Äôt make friends with other artists around me because it‚Äôs like my works scares them off, I know I studied like my life depended on it and it shows, but I still love seeing other artist‚Äôs works, sharing creative ideas and advice. It isn‚Äôt like I don‚Äôt struggle making friends or finding relationships, it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs always this wall there, like we‚Äôre in two different worlds.\n\nMy social life really struggled after drastically improving and there‚Äôs not much I can really do outside of just keep being myself and remembering that like-minded people are out there and will come around eventually. It just sucks because it‚Äôs hard to date, hard to socialize, and I just feel like an old person that wants to retire already doing what I enjoy. I want to add more youth in my life, I‚Äôm only 23 and should take advantage of it before my health gets worse with age. Maybe if I can manage to move from the Deep South to a more liberal area next year I‚Äôll have a better time, especially with being bi and nonbinary (but I‚Äôm visibly straight and cis though)",

Also wanting to imlorve my physicality and overall mental and physical health .\n\nI'm a mildly overweight teenage boy . For my unusual benefit I've been ill for a week and a bit . I wasn't feeling as hungry . Most days I'd buy a decent sized choclate bar and eat it and buy one the next day as well again and again,  but since my apatite was not as much I bought one chocolate bar and I only ate it on the third day and it felt forced just because I didn't want it going off or something idk . But then didn't buy another till I got most of my appetite back still took me 2 days and I've still only ate one line  of the choclate . So it looks like I probs won't be buying choclate bars every day anymore . \n\nI'm wanting to also get back into doing weights again mainly doing my left arm first since my right is much stronger since it's my main used arm (I use it for everything,  writing,  picking up , etc etc ) and while also having a family with a male side which has quite high testosterone levels I'm guessing that's why it's much stronger.  \n\nAlso wanting get out at the weekends and play football more instead of being on me Xbox so I can get fitter . \n\nA lot of this I'm guessing will probs improve my mental health , also trying to improve my sleep , just got a new bed sheet which is much better quality , also getting new pillows soon and my grandads partner sadly died ( RIP) and my mam is going to give me some of the money but is also gonna get me a better mattress since I have a spring one with an ok cover to block the springs stil not great.  Also trying go be a better person/friend so I get treated better by people cuase it feels like that's why I gey treated like shit.",

        "title": "The Simple but Definitely Not Easy Guide to \"Just be confident, bro\"",
        "text": "This is for everyone who's gotten annoyed when someone tells them, ‚ÄúBro, you just gotta be confident.‚Äù (It's not always \"bro,\" but it's often \"bro.\") This is especially common advice in dating, but applies to all relationships.. and sure, women hear this too. \n\nIt‚Äôs one of those infuriating phrases like, ‚ÄúJust be yourself‚Äù, which sounds really good in intention (‚Äúbe the honest, authentic version of yourself‚Äù), but is basically worthless since if you could do it‚Ä¶ you would have done it already.\n\nSo, in this post, I‚Äôm going to break down ‚Äúbe confident, bro‚Äù into a framework: the three main components and what you can do to work on each.¬†\n\n**Confidence = Self-Worth + Courage - Trauma**\n\nThis isn‚Äôt some exhaustive psychological analysis‚Äîjust my take on it based on my own experiences. And, again, no b.s. ‚Äúmore confident in 30 days‚Äù promises here; the concepts might be relatively simple, but implementing them is not easy.¬†\n\n**1. Self-Worth (The Power of No)**\n\nLet‚Äôs start with self-worth, because this is the foundation. Without self-worth, there‚Äôs no confidence. You might think courage is the core of confidence, but no‚Äîself-worth comes first. Another way to think of it is dignity. A man without dignity will never be seen as (or feel) confident even if he's willing to take a bullet for someone.\n\nHere‚Äôs how I define self-worth: It‚Äôs your ability to say no to things that make you feel bad about yourself **in order to be liked**.\n\nThis is less often about saying no to other people (although it is, sometimes), and more often about saying no to your own undignified, approval-seeking behavior.\n\n**For example:** You like someone, but they‚Äôre not showing you any real interest, or they are pulling away.¬†\n\nInstead of walking away, you start thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe if I just do this thing, or that thing, or give them something, or whatever, they‚Äôll like me.‚Äù That‚Äôs desperation. When you act without self-worth or dignity, people can sense it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much effort you put in‚Äîyour lack of self-worth leaks out.\n\nIf you want to be one of those confident ‚ÄúDGAF‚Äù guys, then you need to understand how they work. It‚Äôs not that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù. They *do* care. The difference is they‚Äôre not willing to trade their dignity for someone‚Äôs approval. Self-worth means doing things because you genuinely want to, not because you‚Äôre hoping someone will like you for it.\n\n**How to Practice It**\n\nStart by training your mindfulness. Not the meditation kind‚Äîthe real-time, moment-to-moment kind. Before you act, pause and ask yourself:\n\n* *‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù*\n* *‚ÄúAm I doing this because I genuinely want to, or because I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll like me?‚Äù*\n\nIf it‚Äôs the latter, practice saying no. It‚Äôs not easy, but the more you do it, the stronger your sense of self-worth becomes.\n\nHint: the more you feel the urge to do something, the more time you should take before you act on it.\n\n**Important Caveat:**\n\nIf you realize your motivation is mixed‚Äîif you‚Äôre doing something partly because you want to but also because you want to be liked‚Äîdon‚Äôt do it. That little bit of ‚ÄúI want to be liked‚Äù is poison. It‚Äôs going to seep into your actions and make them feel off.\n\n**2. Courage (The Power of Yes)**\n\nIf self-worth is saying no, courage is saying yes‚Äîto things you want but are afraid to go after. Courage is about risk-taking. Not reckless risk, but social risk: the willingness to face rejection, failure, or embarrassment. Yes, it‚Äôs about life-or-death risk too, that‚Äôs not what we are discussing here.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Asking someone out.\n* Telling your boss you deserve a raise.\n* Making a joke that may or may not fly... because \\*you\\* think it‚Äôs funny.\n\nCourage is the practice of going after what you want without knowing how it‚Äôs going to turn out. But here‚Äôs an important distinction: courage isn‚Äôt about forcing yourself to do something you don‚Äôt care about. It‚Äôs about pursuing what actually matters to you.\n\n**Practical Step:**\n\nAgain, mindfulness. When fear kicks in, acknowledge it: ‚ÄúYeah, this might not work out. They might laugh at me. She might say no.‚Äù Then remind yourself: ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt try, I‚Äôll lose my dignity anyway. I‚Äôd rather fail than not try at all.‚Äù\n\nStart with daily small acts of courage, and then build up. Courage is a muscle - it gets stronger with training.\n\n**3. Trauma (The Confidence Killer)**\n\nHere‚Äôs where it gets heavy.¬†\n\nTrauma is the invisible weight that makes self-worth and courage harder for some people. It‚Äôs why confidence feels relatively easy - or even natural - for some and nearly impossible for others.\n\nTrauma, especially complex trauma, often comes from repeated early experiences where you were punished for showing self-worth or courage.¬†\n\nMaybe you said no and were shamed for it, or weren‚Äôt allowed to set boundaries. Maybe you weren‚Äôt given approval and attention unless you did what the grown-ups wanted. Maybe you expressed your desires and got rejected harshly. Over time, this trains you to avoid risk and suppress your needs, which, ironically enough, makes you ‚Äòneedy‚Äô and lacking in confidence as an adult.\n\nIf you find yourself hyper-sensitive to rejection, unable to say no, or constantly bending over backward for approval, trauma might be playing a role.\n\n**What Can You Do?**\n\nDespite all the bro-solutions out there (stoicism, mindfulness, whatever), trauma isn‚Äôt something you can ‚Äúwillpower‚Äù your way out of. It requires deeper work‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs therapy, introspection, or just starting to notice the patterns. There‚Äôs no simple plan I can offer here like the suggestions above, but the good news is that practicing self-worth and courage will start to reveal the places where trauma holds you back.\n\nIf you are lucky, working on #1 and #2 may be enough for you, but, realistically, most of us end up having to dive deeper and start to look at #3. I certainly did.\n\nIf this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nWhat has worked for you? What hasn‚Äôt? What are you struggling with at the moment? You are also also welcome to ask me any questions in the comments about what has worked (and hasn‚Äôt) for me, and I‚Äôll do my best to get back to them.",

I love your beautiful encouragement for people to be more curious about trauma. you're so right that the solution to trauma is to practice self worth and the courage to remember we are radically worthy of respect and love no matter what. remember too that the topic of trauma can get into so many theories and long winded memories of cause and effect. if trauma comes up, you don't need to remember all this stuff- just remember to not use shame or fear to persuade yourself to take actions, and actively look for what thoughts and actions, and environments let you feel secure, joyful, peaceful etc and you will be good"

Why would I want to be friends to someone who thinks their ill behavior is acceptable. ",

Obviously I was heartbroken and depressed for months . I had to move back in with my folks.\nafter 4 failed interviews I finally landed a new job which pays well. I am getting my first paycheck this Friday so I‚Äôm very grateful for that and not have to worry about my basic bills not being payed. I felt very isolated since I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone beside my parents and one or two friends. I‚Äôm glad I work in a place where this is lots of people to socialize with hopefully I can make new friendships as well.\nI‚Äôm in a better place than a year ago emotionally I am no longer sad or depressed about the breakup. There is times where I think about it and just disappointed in how the situation came to an end. I feel pretty detached for the most part . I think a huge part is because my focus has shifted to myself more and the job so I don‚Äôt have time to think about it.Although my self worth, is something that I do question due to the break up. In the beginning I felt worthless, disposable. It fueled me though to really analyze myself and see how can I be a better person . I read self improvement books, and journaled though out the year , I updated my wardrobe to have a more stylish look , made sure I kept up with hair cuts and personal appearance and went to the gym \nI ve been consistently going to the gym for over a year now which something I never thought I would do. I am pretty slim already but wanted more tone body and the result are great so far. Been researching what foods to eat and how much to eat. I still have ways to go but now It‚Äôs has been set in motion. I just have to save some money , pay some debt and I‚Äôll be able to get my own place. I‚Äôm not sure how I came this far but I did. The break up was the worst experience I‚Äôve had. All the plans I had crumbled. I do believe the worst is ever and I look forward to seeing what happens next. I‚Äôm not looking for my next person yet even though the idea sounds nice. But I need to be in a better place in life. ",

It's like I feel FOMO. I have the idea if I don't buy everything NOW I will miss out. \n\nI'll give an example. Half a year ago I discovered the wonders of cycling (the Tour de France style , not leisure). I instantly went out and bought a bike, proper cycling shoes, helmet, etc. I could go on but you get the idea. I realized very quickly this wasn't healthy for my savings. Although it's great to be enthusiastic, it's better to buy things in increments if you don't have the funds. \n\nI started writing a check list of everything I needed for a certain hobby and taped it to my bathroom mirror. I wrote a little note on the list that reads 'remember don't rush, you'll get there, and when you do it will be awesome'.\n\nThis has helped me and now after 4 months of slowly buying what I need for cycling, I am enjoying every bit of it . \n\nI hope this helps others as it helps me! Have a good one people :) ",

I ended up selling/donating most of the kit and did a conversion of my road bike into a full carbon(frame, wheels, crank, bars, saddle etc but everything second hand and from the '07 era give or take) single speed machine to cruise the streets on a sunday. I bought my road bike in 2019 but it was fitted with Dura-Ace from 2007. My shoes are fully carbon soled but because they were in a highlighter yellow colour scheme nobody bought them so I got them less 65% (Scope the local bike shops and go digging for old stock)\n\nRecently the photography bug bit me again but, with my new found \"Under-equpping\" mentallity I got an old Canon 4D Mkii and a 1.8 prime for cheap cheap and until I have reached a bottleneck with that I won't buy anything else. \n\nDepending on the hobby I find that anything from the 2010's era is probably still good enough that there isn't a reason you can't get by with it most fo the time."

Idk if it matters but I do have ADHD and Bipolar 1. So I am fairly positive that contributes to the issue. (I am medicated and not in any mood episode)\n\nAll I want to do is STFU! But I can't keep my mouth from flapping. It's infuriating!!! How do you stop yourself from always opening your mouth?

        "text": "Sometimes, it‚Äôs easy to feel like we‚Äôre putting in the effort but not seeing the results. Whether it's working toward a personal goal, building a new habit, or improving your productivity, the process can often feel slow and unremarkable. But what if you could see every bit of progress, even the smallest steps? That‚Äôs where tracking comes in‚Äîand it‚Äôs a game-changer for motivation.  \n  \nWhen we keep track of our actions, we start to build a visual representation of our efforts. Whether you‚Äôre jotting down daily achievements, logging habits, or marking off tasks, the act of tracking gives you a tangible record of everything you‚Äôve done. This visual cue can be incredibly powerful, reminding you that progress is happening, even when it feels like things are moving slowly.  \n  \nSeeing how far you‚Äôve come is a huge motivator. It helps you shift focus from the end goal (which can sometimes feel distant) to the journey itself. For example, if you‚Äôre working on a fitness goal, tracking your workouts and seeing the consistent improvement over time can boost your confidence and keep you motivated to push harder. Or, if you‚Äôre trying to build a habit, looking back at your streak of successful days can show you how much progress you've made, making it harder to give up.  \n  \nTracking also helps you break down larger, overwhelming goals into smaller, manageable pieces. Instead of thinking, \"I have so much left to do,\" you‚Äôll see individual milestones you‚Äôve hit along the way. This not only makes the goal seem more achievable, but it also gives you frequent wins to celebrate, reinforcing positive behavior and building momentum.  \n  \nWhat‚Äôs even better is that tracking doesn‚Äôt just remind you of progress‚Äîit helps you make adjustments when things aren‚Äôt going as planned. If you notice a dip in your activity, you can reflect on what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not, then tweak your approach. This sense of control and awareness is key to staying motivated, as it empowers you to make changes and stay on track.  \n  \nUltimately, tracking your progress is about creating a narrative of success, where each entry is a chapter of growth. It‚Äôs about recognizing that every small step adds up, and that consistency, no matter how small, is what leads to lasting change. So, if you‚Äôre feeling stuck or unmotivated, try tracking your progress. You might be surprised at how much it boosts your drive to keep moving forward.",

        "text": "The title basically. I just started therapy (first steps toward self-improvement!), and one of the biggest hurdles I‚Äôve identified is my lack of self-confidence. Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm actually pretty confident in who I am and what I‚Äôve achieved in life. But when it comes to conflict? That confidence straight-up vanishes. In any areas of my life, private & work alike.\n\nIn those moments, I start doubting *everything*‚Äîmy reality, my thoughts, my boundaries. Instead of standing my ground, I usually just give in to whatever the other person is saying. Speaking up feels impossible because their perception of me somehow takes priority over my own. And to make it worse, I start questioning whether my thoughts or feelings are even valid.\n\nIt‚Äôs a mess, honestly, but I think the root of it is a lack of belief in myself. I don‚Äôt trust that I have the right to hold my ground, and on top of that, I‚Äôm terrified of conflict. My first instinct is always to avoid it‚Äîeven if that means sacrificing my own needs or values.\n\nHas anyone else been through this? How did you work on it? I‚Äôm trying to stand my ground more, but the self-doubt and anxiety keep sneaking back and pulling me into my old patterns. What‚Äôs helped you navigate these situations and start building that inner confidence? ",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt know about you, but more often than I'd like, my head feels like Pandora‚Äôs box. The moment I wake up, it seems the box is already open. I never know what kind of negativity will come out or how long it will linger. It‚Äôs both unpredictable and exhausting.\n\nYet, there are ways to manipulate the box.\n\nWith this post, I want to share one¬†*superior*¬†tool for the mental warfare with yourself. Ready? Let‚Äôs go!\n\n**Our consciousness is limited.**  \nThe day has only 24 hours, and there isn‚Äôt enough time to create an endless stream of negative thoughts. You can literally become an expert at keeping your mind occupied with positive ones‚Äîand it‚Äôs surprisingly simple.\n\nWhen I was 22, I had a small palm tree in front of my bed. I took great care of it, but eventually, it became sick. Within weeks, all its leaves turned brown and fell off. What was left was a dead plant‚Äîthe first thing I saw every morning when I woke up. It was depressing. For weeks, my first thought upon waking was sadness and frustration because I believed I had taken good care of it.\n\nOne day, I said to myself:¬†*‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù*¬†I got out of bed, took the plant outside, and threw it in the garbage. (But not before thanking it for all the joy it had brought me when it was alive‚Äîhaha.)\n\n**What's the lesson here?**\n\nWe can‚Äôt always control the thoughts that arise, but we¬†*can*¬†control physical triggers. Your environment plays a huge role in shaping your thoughts. Design it to encourage the kind of thinking you want to have.\n\nNoam Chomsky once said about mass media:\n\n‚ÄúThe smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.‚Äù\n\nYou have the power to limit your focus to specific triggers that keep you on the trajectory¬†*you*¬†desire‚Äînot the one others want for you.\n\n**What changed after this ‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù moment?**  \nI changed¬†*everything*. The TV had to go. I sprinkled notes with my favorite quotes and questions all over my apartment:\n\n*‚ÄúHappiness is a decision. ‚ü∑‚Äù*\n\nI removed almost every trigger that made me procrastinate or feel bad about myself. I even had to let go of some people that long time ago stopped serving our friendship. I shifted my focus from money to passion and relationships.\n\nSoon, my walls were covered with pictures of my favorite artists and idols. Every time I looked at them, I felt pride and inspiration.\n\nYes, many of us live in misery and without perspective. But there‚Äôs a vast, untapped potential in how we create our reality.\n\n**So here's the question for you:**\n\nWhat can you change today in your immediate environment to create more positive triggers for your mind?",

        "text": "Hello. This might be a bit long. Forgive me. Thank you for reading if you do.\n\nI am 22-years-old, and I want to become better.\n\nCurrently, I am a student who is about to finish a degree in urban design and sustainability. I plan to go back to school to also study architecture. I'll be 25 when it's all said and done. I have a 4.10 GPA.\n\nI make music, but I want to get better. I get a lot of fulfillment out of it, and I feel creating brings me joy. I want to eventually make an album for myself. I love art, and I do a lot of creative work like graphic design and video editing just for fun.\n\nI am trying to work out and achieve my dream body. I'm currently trying to learn French, and I have a bunch of other hobbies lined up for me to try once I have the time. Coding, woodworking, drawing, boxing. Some day.\n\nI want to develop spiritually and philosophically. I don't really know where to start, but I'm trying. Right now, I do deeply value everything around me, and I feel everything is interconnected and beautiful. I feel my purpose is simply to experience and enjoy life, and try to experience as much of it as I can to develop my soul. I feel I am simply a part of the whole, and I am happy with this. That being said, I would love to go deeper and develop a larger purpose for myself to push myself through hardship.\n\nThis all being said, I feel stuck. I often rush through my assignments, I avoid making music or creating out of fear of disappointing myself, I am extremely unmotivated to work out most days, and I am struggling to maintain a consistent routine for learning French. Most days, I feel so unmotivated and unproductive that I just watch YouTube or play games all day. Nothing is wrong with that. I've always loved video games and there's nothing wrong with relaxation, but I feel like I lose when I feel guilty for doing these things in place of the others.\n\nIn spite of it all, I feel I am lazy, unmotivated, and immature. I feel I waste my time, and I take shortcuts. I lack deep understanding and intelligence. I cannot actualize the future I want. In spite of my efforts, I can't say I feel I'm actually progressing. I'm still the same I was 5 years ago. This upsets me so deeply.\n\nI lack deep meaningful connections with others. I have a girlfriend who I love deeply and a small group of friends from high school, but I find it difficult to form connections with new people. I can easily form friendly casual relationships, but nothing deeper. I don't even know where to start. I've been quiet and shy growing up, but I'm trying to change that.\n\nSome days, I feel stupid compared to my peers, or that I have an extremely simple understanding of nearly everything around me. I don't understand things deeply enough to matter. I can't express myself well. I'm emotionally, intellectually, mentally, and spiritually immature, and I don't know how to get out.\n\nI think it has something to do with my upbringing. I am extremely hard on myself, and I want to be passing my own standards at all times. If I can't, I don't feel confident. This creates pressure, so I remain stagnant. Can't fail if I don't start. Better to avoid stress, it's simply too hard.\n\nI don't know. I just need some direction. I want to be a beacon of creativity and positive energy. I want to be at peace with myself and my abilities. I want to grow confidence in my choices and my life. How can I balance my goals and truly grow as a person? If you have any tips, books, lifestyle changes, etc., it would be deeply appreciated",

It doesn't matter as much as you are making it seem.\n\n\nHowever, friends are important. Try making friends with people at work. Reconnecting with old acquaintances,  join some new hobby, etc. This advice seems really generic as I write it  and I do know it's hard to make new friends, I am 30 so I get it.\n\nAll you can do is focus on bettering yourself day after day. Remain open. Stay friendly. If new people are meant to come into your life  either romantically or as friends, they will appear.\n\nWatch that movie though if you haven't seen it. Super funny and is about a guy who is getting married and is on the search to make some guy friends to get a best man."

        "text": "Today was a pretty good day. I did my weekly weigh in finally and weighed in at 274.0. It felt great to be about a pound down or around even from my last weigh in. I was hoping for this and feel incredible about it. The feeling was a good one to lead the day. I had work and didn't eat too much in anticipation of dinner at home. I ate a few things like soda bread to have something from work I haven't had in a while. My mom was making sauce and even got pasta with extra protein for the both of us. Her sauce is great and helps me out with meal prep as well. It's not perfect for my distribution of protein versus fats but right now I am trying to save money where I can while being as healthy as possible. Nothing too exciting to report about work except seeing customers I truly missed. I also helped to locate a mug a coworker truly cherished and apparently had a bounty on it for whoever found it. Not the reason I found it but she insists on the money and it will go towards my tires for wintertime. During work the soles of shoes kind of exploded. They were an old pair my great grandmother found so I think the adhesive was worn down despite the shoes looking new. I stepped in one puddle and the shoes were just done for. I have my other pair of shoes from my trip that are lacking soles but can deal with a lack of comfort until I can find a new pair hopefully with Black Friday deals. I looked for shoes to buy at cheaper places and more expensive places and I just have no idea. I didn't go to the gym because I felt unsafe with how bad the shoes came apart. I didn't want the sole to come fully off while I was working out, causing me to harm myself. I played it safe. I went home and had dinner and watched some streams. I then stubbed my toe so we will see about tomorrow's workout. I really want to workout but maybe these are just signs for a rest day. Besides all that here is what went into the body:\n\nLunch:\n\n50 g of soda bread - ~145 calories (~3.3 g protein)\n\n1 ounce of pasta salad - ~55 calories (~1.7 g protein)\n\n~412 g of Antipasto - 125 - 175 calories (3 - 5 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\n178 g of orange - ~95 calories (~1.6 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n97 g of Protein + pasta - 330 calories (17.3 g protein)\n\n~176 g of sausage (hard to tell with sauce clinging to it so I took some grams off) - ~545 calories (~36.9 g protein)\n\n~178 g of meatball - ~225 calories (14.3 g protein) \n\n369 g of sauce (based it off Rao's Marinara and added some calories but it was homemade) - ~370 calories (~6 g protein)\n\nDessert:\n\nLeftover candy - 100 calories\n\nSBIST was the feeling someone gave me when they saw me at my job. One of the customers who I used to see pretended to double take and then shout my name. It made me feel very good about myself and I missed her as well. She always treated me well and asked about my life. She did the same and listened to me and about my journey. Then I saw another customer who always liked to talk to me about my nerdy hobbies and love for fun things. It was great to see these people again and them expressing it to me was great.\n\nTomorrow my plan is to work some more and if I can go to the gym I will. The only problem is I stubbed my toe pretty badly chasing after my mom's dog because he just had to be put into her room. It hurts right now more than any other stubbed toes in a long time. I won't work out if I think it could jeopardize further injury. I ate and went to bed without thinking to ice it or anything. I want to work out but sometimes it isn't in the cards. Thank you my conjurers of the wooden chests. You bring me great pain at times but are great for storage!\n",

We're bombarded with curated versions of others' lives‚Äîtheir highlight reels‚Äîwhile our own day-to-day seems mundane in comparison.\n\nTo that, society often hands us a script with a set sequence‚Äîgraduate, find a job, get married, buy a house‚Äîall by a certain age. But this supposed blueprint is as arbitrary as it is unrealistic. Life isn‚Äôt a preset, linear path.\n\n# What you can do about it\n\n1. **Redefine success on your terms:**¬†Ask yourself personal questions that will help you understand what¬†*success*¬†means to you. For instance:\n   * What are the things I care most about in life? (eg. family, security, freedom, money, status, impact, etc);\n   * How do I define success? (eg. having bunch of friends, improving the life of young people)\n   * Is there a place I can head to that would be worth heading to?\n2. **Focus on**¬†***your***¬†**timeline**: The journey to fulfillment is deeply personal and non-linear. If you keep moving in a direction that feels meaningful to you, you‚Äôll get there eventually. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWho sets the timeline I‚Äôm following?‚Äù¬†Often, the answer reveals the societal pressures that skew our self-assessment.\n3. **Audit your information diet**: You are what you consume. Try and align your digital consumption with growth. Don‚Äôt get into toxic arguments, unfollow people who make you feel worse.\n4. **Adopt a systems mindset**: Create systems that prioritize consistent, incremental progress over sensational milestones. Write daily, engage with thought-provoking content, or start a passion project. I like putting such things in my calendar so I have block of time carved out just for that.\n5. **Live intentionally:**¬†Knowing what you care about and where you want to go is a huge step forward. The next step is doing everything you can to get there while staying true to yourself‚Äîthat‚Äôs intentional living. Journal your wins to track progress, proactively search things that push you forward, and practice gratitude and appreciation instead of comparison.\n\nThis is derived from my thoughts and past experiences I've finally put on paper last week. Keen to learn what worked for you? I'm chatting with some highschoolers this week and in a spirit of helping others would love some interesting takes on that topic!",

My parents were 45 and 48 when they had me and I'm an only child so maybe thats apart of it. My whole family was much older than me growing up. I was always labeled as the \"weird girl.\" People my own age don't take me seriously and they think I'm either weird, annoying, or awkward I've found. Or immature. I never really feel apart of anybodys group. Like I always feel excluded whether its physically or emotionally. I'm made fun of, taken advantage of, and just generally treated like shit. But it's the complete opposite with people much older than me. They say I'm mature, have a good head on my shoulders, give really good advice, and really nice to have a conversation with. And it sucks because all I've ever wanted has been to just fit in. I can't even get a boyfriend because they I'm so weird. I've always just felt like a total outcast. Like some kind of alien. And people don't think I notice when they blatantly say awful things about me. I also feel very childish at the same time because I had a lot of horrible stuff happen to me when I was young so I try to make up for it. It's all very strange.",

I graduated last year and I haven‚Äôt put it down yet. \n\nMy grandmother had nearly fatal lung cancer from smoking her whole life, and during that same time frame my mom found out I was vaping. She wasn‚Äôt mad or surprised, more so just disappointed and hurt. I think that‚Äôs the worst part. Her mother was dying and she found out her child was going to have the same fate. \n\nI tried cold turkey, not for me. I have a few mental illnesses which makes it harder for me, along with the addiction gene. I became a total raging bitch when I went cold turkey, lasted about a week before I felt so miserable about myself I picked it up again. \n\nI used to only use menthol pods, couldn‚Äôt touch anything flavored without getting extremely nauseous, so I decided to get a strongly flavored vape. Thought it would let me cut down on using it because I found them so disgusting. It‚Äôs been 6 months and woohoo what do you know, I love the flavor and can‚Äôt do menthol anymore without being nauseated. \n\nTried nicotine patches about 2 months ago, they helped the best so far but still wasn‚Äôt enough. I also ended up dealing with a very stressful situation during that time so picked up the vape again. \n\nI quit smoking weed cold turkey about 6 months ago and it sucked, but nothing near as bad or as hard as this. \n\nBasically, I just don‚Äôt know what to do or how else to go about this. I feel pathetic and embarrassed that first of all, I rely on a little box of chemicals, and second of all, that my I can‚Äôt get rid of the thing that nearly killed off my favorite person. It‚Äôs almost like that‚Äôs not enough motivation, and it just feels so bad. \n\nAnother issue I have, every single one of my friends and my boyfriend‚Äôs friends vapes or smokes, which makes it harder. I could ask that they don‚Äôt do it around me, but at the end of the day that‚Äôs ridiculous because I‚Äôm with them more than I‚Äôm alone. My sister does as well, so when I‚Äôm home I can‚Äôt get away from it either. \n\nWork helps some because I‚Äôm working retail right now and can‚Äôt touch it unless I‚Äôm on break and run to the bathroom, so that helps me for about 6-8 hours a day, but the second I‚Äôm off it‚Äôs all I want. \n\nI need help. Does anyone have any ideas? What helped you? What else can I try, and how can I motivate myself more to get rid of this stupid thing that‚Äôs going to kill me? \n\nTLDR- I want to quit vaping but nothing I‚Äôve tried has worked. It nearly killed my grandmother and that‚Äôs still not enough motivation to stop. What can I do ? ",

But sometimes this leads me towards unhealthier behaviors like smoking weed which I've had problems with in the past. And sometimes these unhealthy behaviors make things worse, because after I do them I feel guilty and bad about myself so I again over restrict, which leads me to want to act out unhealthy behaviors, and on and on. I'm wondering if there's any better ways of going about this.",

As they grew older I knew I wanted them to always love and trust themselves, because their intuition and instinct is dead on. It became clear to me that the only way THEY would be able to hold onto that in this world was if they had a model. Also, nothing else worked as well (shame, manipulation, guilt, etc) in terms of increasing my capacity to learn, grow, and love. I went all the way down the rabbit hole of trying to be both perfect and the most responsible human I could be (turns out that's a great recipe for misery and illness) and then I learned all about how humans actually learn (meaning understanding the nervous system and neuroplasticity and so on). Now I live by Howard Thurman's words: \"Do not ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because the world needs people who've come alive.\" It's a very long multi-decade story that will no doubt change again, but this is where I am now."

        "text": "For a bunch of years I was consumed with self hatred and caught in a doom loop. One of the things feeding my self hatred was that I knew I needed help but I wasn't doing anything about it. I finally started seeing a therapist. I went weekly for 2+ years. It was 2 steps forward, 1 step back for the first two years. Now it's 1 step forward. And I keep moving forward.\n\nOne thing that really helped me was the book \"The Four Agreements\". This book appears religious and New Age but it really isn't. It espouses four rules to live by.\n\nBe impeccable with your word\n\nDon't take anything personally\n\nDon't make assumptions \n\nAlways do your best \n\nWhile these are rules to live by, the beginning of this book is what really transformed the way I thought about myself. Here is the passage that moved me to tears then and now.\n\n\"Not being perfect, we reject ourselves. And the level of self-rejection depends upon how effective the adults were in breaking our integrity. After domestication it is no longer about being good enough for anybody else. We are not good enough for ourselves because we don't fit with our own image of perfection. We cannot forgive ourselves for not being what we wish to be, or rather what we believe we should be. We cannot forgive ourselves for not being perfect\"\n\nThis summed up my entire life!! And the source of my never ending self criticism. \n\nIf you are on a journey of self discovery and self improvement, please consider listening to this book. I say listen, not read, because I know for myself that hearing these words in my own voice in my head would  not have had the same impact.\n\nWhen I started to feel better I discovered Gary John Bishop. \"UnFu*k Yourself\", \"Stop Doing That Sh*t\" and \"Grow Up\". He's a tough love guy. He may not be for everyone but his style and what he says really resonates with me. He's the voice in my head when I'm doubting  myself, \"You got this\" in his Scotish accent.\n\nThese authors really helped me. I go back to these titles again and again as a reminder. As I mentioned before, I recommend listening to them, not reading. I truly believe that hearing these ideas in your own voice is not as impactful. Also TFA is read by Peter Coyote and and Gary John Bishop has a great scotish accent and is pretty funny.\n\n",

        "text": "Today was the ultimate rest day. I had a combo of many intense workouts for a few days in a row and the cheat day killed me. I enjoyed the food but my stomach had the rumbly tumblies which means my stomach was just feeling heavy and making me feel sleepy. I didn't have work and I wasn't called in so I just hung out with the dog. I decided I definitely was not going to the gym because of how sore I was. I also can't believe how much the spicy chicken I had the day before made me just feel so ugh. I guess that's also a good sign though of me going towards eating healthier and better for my body. My body doesn't want the bad things as much. My mind does but my body gave me the big middle finger. I spent a lot of the day catching up on different things I wanted to read on the Internet and learning different things. I really wish I could day I did a lot but I did not feel good so I rested. I did come up with a cheat day idea further that I mentioned the previous day. I want to recreate the fried pickle ranch whopper from Burger King. I haven't tried it but read about it. The idea sounds good but Burger King can only execute so much. I love cooking so much and I think one of these weeks I want to try and recreate it. I want to make my own dough for sesame seed buns. Instead of the thicker patty they have, I can make lacy edge smash patties. The pickle ranch can be made with better quality pickles and I can add fresh dill and also add some pickled cherry peppers I have. The bacon it has on it can be bacon from my job and the fried pickle fries can instead just be fried pickle chips which are the superior way to eat them. I think I could really improve it. I would enjoy experimenting with a lot of things with this burger and show my best friend whose favorite food is burgers. It would just be something really fun for me to try and I can make something for a cheat day rather than buy it. I am excited to eventually try that when my sister is around. I have to get more into recipe creation again because I love doing it. I have a cookbook I need to read as well for inspiration and writing ideas in the margins. Tye food I ate today was mostly just snacking and eating the little food in the fridge at my grandparents. I tried to stay within my limit and get what I could eat in. Here is what I munched on:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\n170 g of orange - ~90 calories (~1.5 g protein)\n\nLunch/Snack:\n\n1 beef stick -  110 calories (5 g protein) \n\n15 slices of pepperoni - 140 calories (6 g protein)\n\n15 crackers - 240 calories (~2 g protein)\n\n28 g cream cheese - 90 calories (2 g protein)\n\n12 g of hot pepper jelly - ~30 calories\n\n11 g of cheese - ~50 calories (~2 g protein)\n\n67 g of rotisserie chicken - ~200 calories (~15.2 g protein)\n\n132 g of fried egg - ~190 calories (~16.4 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n112 g of egg - ~160 calories (~13.9 g protein)\n\n1 sausage patty - 120 calories (4 g protein)\n\nDessert:\n\nLeftover candy - 100 calories \n\nSBIST was the doggie coming to bed with me. I don't know but something felt really nice about it and made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I couldn't find her thinking I left her outside but she was hiding under my blanket. I got into bed and she didn't want to move so it was bedtime together. I had to look her in the eye though and tell her if I roll on her and crush her then all blame was on her. She needed to hear the message so all guilt could be removed from me. Even though I don't roll like that in my sleep, the precautions were needed. It was just a nice moment and I enjoyed having a pal.\n\nTomorrow will be another work day and maybe another gym day. I want to work out but another rest day could prove useful. I want to see how my body feels and everything that is going on. After that my mom is making sauce so I am excited to have some of that. Tomorrow may be a short and boring day but it could be fun one if I let it. I plan on ending the night by watching a stream and enjoying myself. Thank you my conjurers of the bedside pups. You kept me comfortable on this lazy night.\n",

I realized they‚Äôre not just ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù to be ignored or suppressed‚Äîthey‚Äôre signals. They‚Äôre like a dashboard for your body and mind, telling you when something needs attention.\n\nFor example, I‚Äôve noticed how anger often hides sadness or frustration, or how anxiety is sometimes my brain‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúHey, slow down and figure this out.‚Äù Once I started paying attention to those signals and learning how to respond to them instead of reacting, it felt like this massive weight lifted off me.\n\nIt‚Äôs only been a few days since this clicked, but it already feels life-changing. I feel clearer, more hopeful, and more in control of my choices. \n\nThe biggest takeaway for me is this: \n\nEmotions aren‚Äôt problems to be fixed‚Äîthey‚Äôre tools to be harnessed!

        "text": "You know how they say *\"the more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know\"*?\n\nWell, I feel the same with my personal development journey. I've come a long way and the more improvements and changes I achieve, the more I see areas that I can improve/tweak/change.\n\nThese days I have realized that I can use some improvement when I find myself in disagreement, both in my personal and my professional life.  I am pretty chill, I don't lose my temper or anything like, that, but I wish I was more *\"persuasive\"* about my point, and less abravise.\n\nIn my life I have seen a lot of bac example from people, but I have witnessed 2 great examples:\n\nExample #1: I was involved in a civil lawsuit; I was wronged therefore I was the plaintiff (pro se) against 2 defendants, 2 very large companies and a household names. IANAL but I did OK with discovery and motions. When we went in front of the judge, the 2 defendants had 2 very expensive lawyers who were pissed at me and wasted their time, and probably their clients were pissed because they were not able to make me go away.  Anyway, I stated my case, polished enough; and then one of the lawyer for 1 of the defendants started his speech, and boy he was good. He had the judge eating off the palm of his hand; I could see her (the judge) be drawn to him, and made me look like the bad guy, he *almost* made me feel bad/guilty. So then the judge asked me to respond, to which I said, I have photos to prove my case.  When I showed the photos to the judge her eyes   almost popped out of the sockets. Asked the 2 defendand whether the ptotos represented the truth, and they both nodded. I won the case just like that.\nBut to this day I remember how that lawyer was cool as a cucumber, weathering the storm, and very persuasive with everyone.\n\nExample #2: I was working for a company that was expanding, looking to build a *processing plant* for an investment of about $100 million, creating about 100 new jobs. It could have been located anywhere on the Eastern Seaboard south of NYC. So we were shopping around for areas that would give us incentives in the form of financing and tax breaks. I remember talking with a politician in one of the states where we were interested and this guy talked with me for 45 minutes, very affable, but at the end of the day was not only offering nothing but at the same time luring us into his state. I almost fell for it.  I then realized that he was all fluff and no substance, but his MO drew me in.\n\n----\n\nSo, what books, videos, programs, resources, articles can I tap for becoming cool as a cucumber while disagreeing,  maintaining my cool when the other party is being an abusing a-hole, irrational, angry, manipulative?\n\nI don't expect to just read a quote or a reddit comment and change (the world) immediately.\n\nJust resources, point of views, suggessions to start my journey.\n\nAnd yes I have already googled it and nothing pops out as valid/interesting enough.\n\nIn the past I have read/studied:\n\n* Book: Never split the difference\n* Book: When things fall apart\n* All of the classic books of Stoicism\n\n\nThanks in advance",

I remember my mother told me about how in kindergarten I would just hide under the tables and not speak to the other kids, weird example but It's the first thing that came to mind.\n\nAnyway, recently, I've been wanting to like make actual friends and possibly a girlfriend, as I've been crushing pretty hard on a few girls I like in school. The problem is, I have literally zero idea how to talk to or meet people. Like I get really anxious when encountering a social situation, when it's my turn to speak my mind usually goes completely blank and I kinda freeze up. I also overthink a lot of things I do and say.\n\nAnyway, again, thanks for reading my post, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. :)",

                "body": "There's a lot here. I used to struggle with this very much ... Now I teach communication. What comes to mind after reading your post:\n\n#Uncover what your worst fears are, and reassess them.\n\nInstead of just living with the fact that you freeze up, question why. What are you afraid of happening? What is on the other side of this that is looming so heavily that it causes a freeze? Begin to understand your fears so you can create internal dialogue to speak back at them.\n\nI recommend getting out a piece of paper and just writing the question at the top, and writing whatever comes in your head without judgement, or without trying to think about whether it's actually the \"right\" answer. Word vomit onto that page. Write the WORST case scenario that could possibly happen, and identify what meaning you ASSIGN to it.\n\nYou must change the meaning behind your fear. Are you afraid other people rejecting you will mean youre unlovable, so you say nothing to avoid that from being confirmed? Do other people's opinions have so much power over you that you'd be defined eternally by a single rejection or mistake? What is beneath the surface of your \"freeze\"?\n\nOnce you isolate this, rationalize it. Is it realistic? I used to think that if I made a mistake in what I said, people would think I'm stupid, and to me, being stupid meant that I was unlovable, and therefore I'd LITERALLY DIE and cease to live... So I'd only engage with things I excelled in and knew the answers to. I'd never try new things or talk to new people because if I made a mistake, it would unconsciously mean that I'd die.\n\n I changed the meaning of what all of this meant to me, because when I rationalized it this way:\n\"If I walk up to the girl I like and say something that makes them not like me, will I actually die?\" The answer is fuck no, I won't die, wtf? Why would that kill me? \n\nThe reality is I lost nothing at all. I never spoke to her before, then tried to say something, and it didn't work. I'm literally in the exact same place as where I started, the only difference is I get to be proud of myself for trying something at all, and I now have more information on how I should approach things in the future.\n\nThis leads me to the second thing which is give 0 fucks about the outcome, focus on taking steps forward and making ANY progress. Process is all that matters, outcomes are icing on a cake. You don't have to be perfect and get girls numbers and have tons of friends, but you DO have to start somewhere if you want what you say you want.\n\nThird thing is start meditating and learn to be present with yourself and your own body. Learn to control the rhythm and pace at which you live. You're allowing your biology to dominate your experience, so you have to tip that scale back into your control.\n\nAfter practicing meditation for enough time consistently, you will find the world to be much clearer and a lot less overwhelming. You'll control your focus better, and better ideas come to mind. You need to become aware and present in these moments when you're getting elevated around other people, and intentionally being yourself back down to ground 0. This takes practice. What you're experiencing is freezing up, but what your body is experiencing is probably increased heart rate and improper breathing, which both make the issues worse.\n\nYoure in control, don't choose to believe you aren't. Take the control back. Hope these tools help you OP"

Coming from a similar situation as you where I was stressing day in and day out on why I wasn't meeting such high expectations I set for myself, my mental health only improved when I stopped belittling myself and trying to instead enjoy the present moment.\n\nBut above all, know that with time your stresses will be gone, and things will work out.

I don't even think about taking something to calm down because I usually lack energy to begin with.  I like this excitement but it has been a little harmful. Tips?",

You have periods where one person is your best friend, then maybe circumstances change and some other person becomes your main buddy. It really depends what you want to do with yourself. Self-improvement is basically a growth mindset, and if you're around other friends who would much rather drink, take drugs and talk about celebrity gossip, that's the level you're going to think at - at least while you're with that group, anyway. \n\nNow, there's a way around this... if you do all your best work by yourself - hence the personality thing I mentioned at the top. You can still hang out with people wildly different to you in terms of intelligence, life choices, lifestyle etc etc, and it won't impact you because your best thinking is done when you're at home. It requires a lot of mental flexibility...maybe  you hang out and talk stupid shit with a certain friend/friends, then you go home and return to your calculations on anti-gravity propulsion systems. It can be done, it's just a LOT harder and requires a lot of compartmentalization."

        "text": "My boyfriend started a company and works in computer security..he has a proprietary cyber security product that he plans to roll out early 2027. Here's where the issue starts. His goes to his office every weekday (11am-8pm, Mom to Fri). His commute is 2 hours each way. He comes home everyday and is too tired to work on the product code. He wakes up at 7 to go to the gym every weekday. \n\nOn the weekends he gets into a loop of staring into his phone and wasting the day away..he feels horrible afterwards. I want to help him so bad. He's a brilliant person but his phone addiction is bringing him so much pain. He is aware of the problem. He knows it's his phone is causing him to while away the whole weekend..\n\nI run my own company, and the way I enter my uninterrupted flow state is by going to a quiet cafe, ordering a coffee (Iced Americano) and just going at the work at hand for 5-6 hours straight. It works so good for me. But this method does not work for him. He gets distracted and overwhelmed by the people around him and ultimately stops working. \n\nMy question is: \n1) What is your work type? Like how do you enter your flow state? I want to try and identify my boyfriend's flow state trigger. Like for me, going to a cafe where I know people are watching me gives me motivation to work. \n\n2) I know he's afraid of asking for help. So what can I do passively to help him out. Eg. I can try and take his phone away. Or I can try and find a genuine co-op working space. Something that is conducive to a genuine working motivation. \n\nAny and all help is appreciated. Thanks for reading this far..",

                "body": "First, I'll tell you about my favorite productivity ideas.\n\n\n\nOur mental strength and creativity is greatest in the early morning. I discovered a great brainstorming method called Morning Pages. It's writing three longhand, stream of consciousness pages right after waking up. Stream of consciousness - just writing whatever pops into your head at the moment. \n\n\n\nA famous scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz said that he always solved problems by thinking about them carefully and then putting them aside. Solutions would come to him out of the blue later, often while he was going for a walk.\n\n\n\nMy all-time favorite OP for doom scrolling -- Thanks, fellow redditor Thi5ath-KR !\n\n\n\nI know many of you guys are struggling with phone addictions or simply have realized that you waste your time doom scrolling, so here's exactly what I wish me 2 years ago could have read to save a lot of time in learning to moderate my usage.\n\n\n\n1- Change up your environment: Simply waking up and seeing your phone on your bedside table will trigger you to open it then and there, but these cues exist everywhere. I kept my phone in a drawer so that if I really needed to use it I could go ahead, but I wouldn't get urges by simply seeing my phone.\n\n\n\n2- Making activities harder to do: I increased the number of steps in between me and doing bad habits (scrolling, texting, etc.) by deleting TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat. It's honestly funny- just like that, my brain thought it was too much effort to go to the App Store and reinstall them.\n\n\n\n3- Gradually decreasing: This is probably the most important point. Whenever I went on dopamine detoxes, I'd usually succeed but then fall right back into my bad habits. Then, I kept introducing more beneficial activities into my life (joining a sports club, starting content creation, working out) and gradually over time, I got used to using my phone less. Cold turkey just didn't work for me.\n\n\n\n4- Purpose: Definitely the aspect I overlooked the most. I was trying to quit my phone addiction even though I had basically no main motivation behind it. Basically, I was unambitious and never really considered setting huge dreams for myself. I know, this may seem irrelevant but trust me, just set big goals for your life. Then, you'll understand each and every way your phone usage is hindering your progress.\n\n\n\nHope this helps, take action ;)"

        "text": "Okay, I need some advice. I'm a 23-year-old guy, and for the past two years, I've been stuck in my comfort zone. My life looked like this: I was studying social work, attending classes, and spending a lot of time at the gym. I also spent a lot of time with my grandparents or at home. I made some connections on campus, but they never really grew into strong friendships.\n\nI'm passionate about sports, but I don't enjoy going out or partying at all. I‚Äôd hear about people who work hard but also go out often, and I couldn‚Äôt relate. At that time, I was also very insecure and shy when it came to reaching out to people or making plans. I know I can‚Äôt blame anyone else‚ÄîI‚Äôve kept myself in this comfort zone. I didn‚Äôt push myself to break out of it, partly because my surroundings weren‚Äôt very motivating either. Going out alone felt intimidating, so I never really did it.\n\nMy family has also been quite introverted and reserved. Some of them think in very rigid ways, and I‚Äôve started to grow tired of constantly hearing things I don‚Äôt agree with. I feel like it‚Äôs holding me back rather than helping me grow.\n\nOver the last few years, I‚Äôve developed a lot socially. For example, I‚Äôve become more empathetic and a good listener, which I never thought I‚Äôd be. But on my final internship, I ended up quitting because it wasn‚Äôt the right fit. The feedback I received was that I didn‚Äôt take enough initiative or show my authentic self.\n\nAnother thing that has been weighing on me is that, for the past two years, I‚Äôve had feelings for a female friend. I‚Äôve never told her because I was afraid it would ruin our friendship or that it wouldn‚Äôt work out.\n\nThese are all factors that have held me back from stepping outside my comfort zone. On top of that, my family, especially my brother and parents, has always been overprotective. For example, when I was 16-17 years old, they didn‚Äôt let me go out or experience much, which I feel caused me to miss out on a lot.\n\nBut again, I don‚Äôt want to come across as a victim. I know I‚Äôve kept myself stuck in this situation. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve gone out, had a girlfriend, or experienced intimacy. I often blame my lack of time, but deep down, I know that‚Äôs not the real reason‚ÄîI just haven‚Äôt taken responsibility for it.\n\nAfter quitting my internship, my teachers and program coordinator suggested that I switch to another field, something where I can guide and work with groups of people, which has always fascinated me. But lately, I‚Äôve become more and more aware that I need to break free from my comfort zone and stop doing the same things over and over. I know staying where I am won‚Äôt lead to growth.\n\nThe problem is, I feel stuck. I‚Äôm afraid of going against my family‚Äôs expectations, and I have no idea where to even start. Should I try going out alone? How do I take the first step?",

He said, \"You can write all the information you want on a 3 by 5 card and use that when you're taking the test.\"\n\nLearning math-science subjects is basically about learning to solve problems. It's not really about memory.\n\nWhat you want to do is learn how to solve problems, practice solving them, and use the idea of the 3 by 5 card to write your own math book - a notebook with all the information you need - all the equations and the steps involved in solving problems.\n\nCourse guides like Cliffs Algebra I are better than textbooks - they have to be for students to buy them. \n\nA site that gives you LOADS of problems to practice with is IXL.  It's not cheap but if you want to learn math, IXL is worth it.\n\nLearning algebra is learning to use tools. If you spend a lot of time learning one tool, it's time well spent.\n\nThink in terms of examples and visualize. It often helps to draw little pictures in your notes, or on your test paper.\n\nWord problems aren't as hard as they seem. You can't hide a lot of information into a word problem, which means that any new information you find is probably the answer, or a form of the answer, like a number of feet per second, which you can convert to miles per hour. If you don't know how to solve the problem, play around with it until you get some new number."

                "body": "I agree with the other commenter, who said to try to find something you're grateful for. But I think another good place to start, is by being kinder to yourself. Try not to judge yourself too much. Sometimes when we do this, it makes a negative thought more powerful. Instead, if we just allow the negative thought to flow over us, then it's not as significant. So I think it's good to not judge your thoughts too much. \n\nSomething else is that you may have depression, which can improve with therapy, and possibly meds if they're necessary. Though I think you should be very cautious about depression meds. They should be more like a last resort, imo, though my meds have been pretty helpful.\n\nI relate with things not feeling \"real.\" It's as though it's pointless, because it's not a physical object, it's more abstract. But these abstract things can be even more meaningful than physical things. I think depression is a big part of my issue with this. It tends to make our accomplishments and hopes seem meaningless. But they really are very meaningful.\n\nAlways remember to be kind to yourself. And remember to pat yourself on the back! Ive not sorted out all my problems, but I'm definitely happier than I used to be, and that's a nice thing! So I'd focus on being more happy first, because it's hard to know what \"happy\" in general means. Also, try a more physical hobby as well, I think this helps with things not feeling \"real.\" I garden, for example. Anyway, I wish you luck!"

It feels overwhelming, and oftentimes insurmountable.\n\nYour mom is right (in terms of cynicism, also could explain at least part of your depression). At this age, it's very common to feel cynical, depressed, anxious, nervous about the future, fearful, angry, etc etc etc. There's really no way out but through. Everybody's gotta take their lumps with this. It sucks, we all know it sucks, but eventually it'll be over, and things will be a lot more clear.\n\nAll you can really \"do\" is keep an open mind and study life. Read philosophy, see what others have said about the worries and concerns you have (*somebody who knows what they're talking about....*), look for the good things in life no matter how seemingly trivial and stupid. When my partner is in his dark place, I tell him that tonight, he's going to sleep with a roof over his head with a full stomach and tomorrow he'll share a laugh with friends. It's the bare basics, but it's not something to be taken for granted; if we have that, we're better off than a LOT of people.\n\nYou probably feel like you've grown so much and come so far - and you have. The amount of growth from childhood to the late-adolescent teenage years is tremendous. But you haven't even begun life yet. When you're 23-years-old, you'll have barely begun life and still won't have a clue. There's nothing wrong with that, it's like that for everyone. I'm coming up on my 30s in a moment and I'm still not ready to say I know everything. You'll never stop evolving, so you may as well admit you still need to keep learning. Really, all you need is some more miles on your odometer, and if you've kept your eyes open, things will start to make a lot more sense. By virtue of being open-minded, things just kind of \"snap into place\" through no additional effort on your part. When things become clearer, your cynicism turns into reasonable skepticism mixed with general optimism. You just have to wait."

I know it might seem like little things like this won't help, I thought the same thing, but you'd be surprised how much of a difference it actually makes.\n\nOnce you start feeling better, take small steps toward socializing.\nWhen you‚Äôre in a better mental place, it becomes easier to connect with others. Be brave and put yourself out there! Look for people who share your interests‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs online communities, hobby groups, or local meetups. Start with small interactions, and over time, you‚Äôll build confidence.\n\nSo yeah, this is what‚Äôs been helping me deal with depression and social anxiety.\nI‚Äôm not ‚Äúout of the woods yet,\" but this is what I‚Äôve put together through working with therapists and talking with other people who‚Äôve been going through similar stuff.

Almost like I have to brace for something to balance out my world. That isn't the real case though, your mind is trying to protect you from the bad things that may happen, but in doing so, it's also leading you down a path of worry and doubt. Then your actions will act based on that and a self-fulfilling prophecy will happen. You can break from that cycle by admitting something- you deserve to be happy. This worry you have is about something that you don't even know, see, or control. Worrying about the what-if only makes you lose sight of what you have in front of you. Embrace the now. Something my best friend slapped some sense into me about lol."

It‚Äôs a constant cycle of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thoughts mixed with the negative patterns of ‚Äúthis is too good for me.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs draining because it keeps you trapped in a cycle where you push away things that could improve how you feel, simply because you‚Äôre not used to them, and psychological patterns of ‚Äúself protection‚Äù take over.

You are not worthless, despite what you may feel or think. \n\nI guess that you're on the younger side because you mentioned school. I completely understand how stressful and upsetting grades can be when they are not great, but know they don't define you as person. Maybe join a club if your school does that, to meet other people there. \n\nAnd video games are awesome, but if it's the online competitive side you're normally playing on that you feel you're not doing great in, I'd suggest go for more story driven or less non-online games for a while. Give the multi-player a break. \n\nI'd also say try and find more hobbies other than video games. Instruments are an excellent way of expressing yourself and getting toxic thoughts to be less cruel. Any kinda excerise, whether it be gym, soccer, boxing is just plain great for your mental and of course your body, but I know how difficult it can be (I have also struggled with depression). \n\nAnyway, there are tons of great hobbies out there for you to explore, you will find yourself being good at something with practice, and it will feel amazing. This will also allow you to meet more people and gain friendships. Try and talk to more people. The more people you try with, the easier it'll get. \n\nThe cutting... Don't do this. Please. Avoid, avoid, avoid. I have not struggled with this, but my ex-girlfriend did. \n\nI hope you have not been bottling all of this inside. I really think you need to have a talk with someone about how you're feeling. Talk to a loved one, and if need be, a professional. Just get some those thoughts out of your head and speak them, it can help keep it more manageable.\n\nI hope I've helped in some way. And sincerely hope things get better for you."

        "title": "37, Homeless, Relationship Failed, No job, Depressed, but actually I'm doing great in reality.",
        "text": "I've been getting sucked into my head and feeling down on myself recently and questioning my life choices. Too much comparing my life to other's lives and too much attachment to outcomes and wondering over what-ifs. This is mostly a letter to myself but I think others might find it motivating.\n\nEverything I wrote in my title is objectively true, but wow, does framing and perspective make a difference.\n\nI don't have a home, but that's by choice. In 2019 I started living out of a van to save money, then saved enough and did well on some businesses so that by '21 I started backpacking around the world full-time(I've since hiked over 18,000 miles). I just came off of a 5 month trip where I hiked 2,200 miles(Appalachian Trail), ran and won a 152 mile race, volunteered for a month with hurricane Helen recovery, and then spent 15 days at a silent meditation retreat. I'm staying with my mom right now swapping out gear and will be headed to Thailand in two weeks for a 4-5 month SE Asia trip.\n\nMy last relationship failed. Wonderful woman with all the qualities I want in a person but ultimately we desired very different lives. She wanted to start a family and settle down while I wanted to continue traveling full time. It was the most difficult decision I've ever had to make but I chose to honor my needs and listen to my intuition rather than letting fear of being alone, fear of not being able to find anyone else like her keep me in a relationship that ultimately wasn't a good fit.\n\nI don't have a job. Because I work for myself. Been working at my own projects for over a decade now with varying degrees of success but have accrued enough skills now that I can support myself without needing to get jobs.\n\nI'm depressed. This is a pretty consistent cycle, winter usually coincides with outdoor adventures ending and sends me into a period of low energy and depression. But now I have a robust toolkit with my meditation practice and understand that this is impermanent and I'm able to maintain healthy habits which greatly mitigate the impact. I'm still meditating 1-2 hours a day, exercising, and eating well. So I'm depressed still but it doesn't impact my life in nearly the same way it used to, I'm not wallowing in it laying in bed all day, I'm able to acknowledge how I feel and still do what I can with my day.\n\nThe depression clouds my perspective with a negative outlook. This post is part of reframing that negativity. I KNOW my depression makes me lose sight of the reality of my situation and blinds me to the myriad possibilities of my life. It makes me compare myself to others and focus selectively on the negatives. Sure, I don't have a home or a spouse or kids or really close friendships and I'm not close to my family. But the flip side of that is I have the ultimate freedom to live life exactly as I wish.\n\nI discussed having kids for a year with my ex and that made me start to feel really old and feel like if I didn't make that relationship work then I'd be missing out completely on lifelong partnership and family and I'd just end up being alone and miserable in my old age...\n\nBut wow that is not reality!\n\nThe reality is I'm in a fucking fantastic position right now.\n\nI'm 37, zero debt, my expenses are insanely low. I don't have a mortgage payment, I don't have a car payment, and I have enough saved and invested to be able to travel indefinitely just living off the interest not to mention I have the skills and have built up a online presence to be able to comfortably fund my lifestyle so I don't even need to tap into my savings and investments. I basically have zero financial stress and can go months at a time without hardly working at all. How many people would absolutely kill to be in this position financially.\n\nI'm in peak health, I was able to hike 2,200 miles this year and then won a 152 mile run. I'm going to train Muay Thai heavily and probably take a few fights. What a wonderful position to be in to have such a healthy strong body, how many old billionaires would give up their entire net worth to go back in time 40 years and gain their health back?\n\nBreakups are hard and that's just the reality. But I've come so far in my ability to meet and connect with others. Wow, if my 20 year old self could see this version where I can hold conversations with women that would have been 1000% out of my league when I was younger. It's really nice to be completely comfortable in my own skin. So this breakup is tough but I'll heal over time and be able to meet more incredible people. I won't be alone forever if I don't want to be.\n\nI've succeeded in making good money in every endeavor I've put my mind to for the last few years. Because I've finally gained enough skills to be successful in business, have the experience and knowledge to know how to prioritize my efforts, and the capital to fund what's required. Even if I had to start all over I'd be able to re-create the life I have now in a few short years.\n\nI've really come SO far and don't need to sabotage myself by focusing on the negatives. My life has a tremendous amount of positive factors going into it and I'm in a position a younger version of me would be absolutely ecstatic about.\n\nHere's where I was 15 years ago:\n\n\\* Massively depressed and addicted to video games.\n\n\\* So much social anxiety I wouldn't even goto the grocery store until I had literally nothing else to eat.\n\n\\* Struggle waking up every morning and chronically late for work because the idea of going into the job just overwhelmed me with anxiety.\n\n\\* Couldn't hold a job more than 3 months due to depression.\n\n\\* Hardly ever got a second date, if I even managed a first date, I was almost 30 before my first meaningful relationship.\n\n\\* Always struggling financially, constantly stressed out because I only had 1-2 months before I'd run out of money.\n\n\\* So afraid and anxious about EVERYTHING in life!\n\nMy plans for 2025:\n\n\\* Train and get to peak physical condition and fight Muay Thai if I'm ready\n\n\\* Hike another 3,000 miles\n\n\\* Bring my online business to 100k/yr revenue.\n\n\\* Deepen my friendships and stay in touch with the good people in my life\n\n\\* Sit two 10 day silent meditation retreats\n\nSo to go from the version of myself who used to be so utterly depressed and despondent of being able to even do the simplest of things like just hold down a job to now where I am confidently traveling solo all around the world, living life exactly as I wish to live it is truly remarkable. I shouldn't feel bad about my life situation. I should be fucking ecstatic at how much progress I've made and fired up to continue putting in the effort to see truly how many of my dreams that I thought were unattainable as a kid can come true.\n\nReally goes to show how important perspective and framing are. We adapt so quickly to our lives and what would have once been a dream come true quickly becomes the mundane that we take for granted. It's so helpful to put our lives into perspective and get reality checks on how things really are. ",

I have suspicion that its due to the reinforcement pattern of 'grades'. You work towards a test / hw assignment; afterwards, you get a correspondent grade back for your work and effort. With all the other stuff I struggle with right now (like networking or learning Microsfot suite etc); I don't get a grade assigned to that; if at all, what I learn apart from school will help me in general but I don't see the results of it directly (in grade form), some may say like oh just gameify your coursera / networking / etc; however, my brain is smart enough that im trying to trick itself; however, am I just making excuses for myself. (**How can I transfer my typa motivation from school into the other things I do?)**\n\nI often times have a planned out to-do-list for the day (like ok today im going to finish all my hw for math, accounting, study for humanitites, and learn some excel or coursera); often, I just get distracted (either I scroll on reels or yt OR just actively avoid starting); I feel the inability to make myself stick to a list comes to the trust I have within myself. It's like deep down after making the to-do list; I know that I probably wont complete it (I say this not to say Im not immediately discouraged; I still attempt to do the work). I think this just reinforces the internal cofidence I have in myself to complete tasks I said I would do¬†**(I just struggle to keep myself accountable and consistent)**\n\nI was also wondering; would life coaching be beneficial for me? or similar programs to keep me accountable. I do realize that this isnt a long term solution because at the end of the day I'm going to keep myself company for most of my life (so therefore I need to hold myself accountable)\n\nidk I say all this to say; whats your advice / outlook on my situation?\n\nTLDR: college student struggles with motivation¬†*(oh so rare)*¬†in doing external things rather then just 'school'",

        "text": "It was another good one full of rest, a great workout, and a cheat day. I got up a bit late and my grandparents came into my room to give me keys before they departed and to tell me the Internet was down. I got my stuff ready and gathered all my laundry since I am able to do it at their house. I haven't been able to do mine so I have quite a few loads. I went down to their house and it was snowing outside. It was very light but it was sure as the world is round that the snow was falling. After I sorted my laundry I headed out for laundry and to get lunch. I headed out to do a workout when my grandmother called me telling me somebody would be stopping by to work on the Internet. I quickly ran to the gym and did a workout. Here was my routine:\n\nSeated leg press:\nReps of 8 6 6 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 55 60 and 65 pounds\n\nNote: Did 30 40 45 at the end of each set only doing one leg 3 times each but 2 at 40\n\nLeg extension:\nReps of 8 6 6 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 70 75 and 80 pounds\n\nSeated leg curl:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 60 65 and 70 pounds\n\nHip adduction:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 85 95 and 100\n\n15 minutes of the stair stepper. I upped how fast it went after 10 minutes from 44 steps per minute to 60.\n\nI had to race back to the house because my grandmother didn't discuss the time with me and I really needed to get a workout in for myself and my body. It takes a while to get to the gym and it just fits in if I do nothing else. I was a bit upset but it is nothing to dwell on. I felt good at what I got accomplished in the gym and pushed even more with my legs. These bad boys are going to be champions one day. After all that I did some laundry and got myself all washed up. I headed back out to get some errands done and grabbed some food. I played a little Pok√©mon Go for a bit more exercise at the mall and then grabbed dinner after grabbing stuff at the store. I headed home to watch my favorite streamer and eat. It was an all around good day and night with a few minor hiccups. My grandparent‚Äôs little dog was a blast to have and mostly kept to herself the whole night. She begged a little bit but I couldn't cave in. She is a great dog but hated me letting her out for the bathroom. Everything was great and I'll be skipping what I write down for my cheat day once again. Food had me inspired though today for making my own cheat day and I have an idea for the future to try and make better fast food for one of my cheat days in the coming weeks, hopefully a week where I see my sister so she can try my experiments. \n\nSBIST was the feeling I had at the gym. Being able to squeeze in a workout and feeling that burn continues to feel great. My body is exhausted though with how much pushing I've been doing, work, and going many days in a row to the gym. Once I'm more used to it and not every day is me testing my limits I'll be able to go almost every day. Right now though I am ecstatic I can get these workouts done and feel good after. The days I question whether or not I should go become days I force myself to because why question it. I like it and it only brings me gains for my body. \n\nTomorrow is a definite rest day. I have been going too many days in a row pushing plus I am feeling my body get sore each time. I have been sore but work different groups of muscles. I think I may even take two days off. That's okay by me because my muscles need it to come back even stronger. I also have to watch my grandparent's dog still for them so I may as well stay there. The food I eat will mostly be what they have as well but there isn't much. It should be a very relaxing day tomorrow with the possibility of being called in for work. Thank you my conjurers of the spice levels. You make food even more zesty and worth eating for me. Even if it hurts me later. \n",

Whether that‚Äôs your job, school work, chores, working out‚Ä¶ anything at all.  Some things are significantly easier than others, but once you get good at ‚Äúpretending‚Äù to like what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôll work A LOT harder, longer, and better.  And it‚Äôs kinda fun if you ‚Äútrick‚Äù yourself well.  The way I do this is just to think of the goal of the task (more specific than just finishing it), for example getting another page written on an essay, then ~mini celebrating when I get it done, like just give yourself that ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù feeling once you‚Äôve done it.  And anticipate that feeling as your working.  Also before you start, don‚Äôt think that you have to do it, kinda act exited about doing it.  If you can get yourself exited/hyped to do it, you‚Äôll get a better start.",

        "text": "**tldr:**   \n  \nWasted 20 years, finally getting on track, but still am prone to exacerbating my ADHD and wasting way too much time on social media, anime (lol), and YT rabbitholes on useless things like politics and problems in the world. How do you all force yourself to have some grit and get things done and minimize wasting time? I know that I should start my days reading or doing something productive but it's so hard to not start with something that should be a reward and then let that set a bad tone for the rest of the day.  \n  \n**Preamble**\n\nSo I'm later in life, in my early 40's. I wasted the first 20 years out of HS. Took 6 years to get my Associate's. Drank, smoked weed, and played video games pretty much anytime outside of work. Had a 4 year period where I was just straight up poor and one layoff away from possibly being homeless and all that fun stuff. All of that was not helped by the fact that I am prone to ADHD and impulsivity and generally poor emotional intelligence.\n\nAround 4-5 years ago I realized that I was not getting any younger and had to get my act together. I think part of the reason I kept myself a loser was because it was comfortable and I was afraid of change. I think the genesis of me wanting to change was learning how to ski. I was so scared my first time or two. Literally clinging to the side of the mountain on easy blue slopes. Something clicked and I said 'f that' and went hard and watched YT videos on how to ski and did something like 60 ski days that season and by the end was doing double blacks and contemplating doing flips.\n\nA year later I quit drinking, for the most part quit weed (definitely quit now), and a year or two ago I quit computer video games and basically just game on my phone when I'm in the bathroom or between sets at the gym. I signed back up for college and finished my BS in 2 years with a 4.0 earlier this year. Now I am enrolled in an MBA program (it's basically free, work's paying for it, so why not?), but it's definitely not at a top 50 school or anything. \n\n**Sounds like I am doing pretty well now right? Well... kinda.**\n\nPart of the reason I went back to school was because my job is basically a dead end job. In the whole department only 1 person has had any kind of promotion in the last 5 years. It's a grind of a job too because anyone hired in the last 3-4 years simply does not give a shit, most literally don't know how to work 80% of the customer base's issues.\n\nBefore I totally quit weed/booze I was really bad at investing. I'd have good or even great picks but then would not have the confidence in my decision making to hold the positions. I was also frankly way too impulsive. Then I'd see that if I had held that I would have made 10x+ returns and would let that eat at me. I also lived well above my income so racked up a bunch of high interest debt. I am finally turning the corner on that and paying it off, but it will take at least 6 months to get my total min payments to under $1500 a month. I might be able to get debt free in a year as long as I keep the discipline up. I also believe that once that debt is paid off I'll be capable of holding long term investments and not liquidating them to lost in short term gambling. I think I at least have gained that modicum of self-control in the last year. \n\n**Where I am trying to get**  \n  \nSo, with only $10k in my Roth and having no real management experience, just some network tech/engineer experience with no notable certifications, I am trying to get to the next level and get a job where I am making at least six figures and is at least a little fulfilling with co-workers that are driven and will push me instead of me fighting the urge of becoming as lazy as them.  \n  \nI want to study. I want to actually enjoy studying. I want to get certifications. I want to become more articulate and better at conversation and connecting and networking. I want to research the best career opportunities and start building an actionable plan. So far it's even been hard to get myself to read for fun, let alone study. I only got through college because frankly it's an online school and the classes are very easy. Even with that I procrastinate and turn things in with hours to go before they'd be late. I am ADHD, but I have found that I can control it by minimizing distractions and getting on the right track at the beginning of the day. If I let myself go on social media and worry about notifications etc., my ADHD goes into another gear and I am practically screwed for the rest of the day.\n\n**So what do you all do? What's worked?**\n\nI'd like to know if anyone has a similar situation and turned it around, how do you make sure you start your days productive? Is there some kind of mantra? Is it making yourself think about the pain from the future if it doesn't work otherwise? How do you catch yourself if you feel you're going off track? Was it some mentor? Is it success-oriented friends keeping you in line? Is it some strategy of taking one step at a time? If you start wasting time, especially on something that doesn't even improve your mood, does something kick in that pisses you off and you immediately stop getting sidetracked? If so, what helped get you to that point?\n\n\\---\n\nThanks for any input and listening to my little story if you were able to make it through all that, lol. :)",

No. Is there a booklet about how you're supposed to behave there?

        "title": "How I Finally Got My Life Together After 20 Years of Chaos",
        "text": "# About me:\n\nFor over two decades, I lived a life completely lacking discipline. I was the textbook definition of a mess:\n\n* I‚Äôd skip school for weeks or months at a time.\n* I‚Äôd spend entire nights binge-watching garbage on the internet, ignoring responsibilities.\n* My grades were abysmal, assignments were always overdue, and I had no focus or direction in life.\n* Add to that an addiction to fast food and endless social media scrolling, and you get a clear picture of someone stuck in a downward spiral.\n\nFast forward to today, and I‚Äôm a completely different person.\n\n* I‚Äôve worked as a software engineer at Fortune 500 companies.\n* My academic performance improved drastically.\n* I consistently lift weights, read books, train in martial arts, and work on my business.\n\nHow did this transformation happen? It wasn‚Äôt overnight, and it wasn‚Äôt by simply ‚Äútrying harder.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs what worked for me:\n\n# 1. I Stopped Relying on Willpower\n\nFor years, I thought discipline was all about willpower. You just ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to do something, and then you do it‚Äîright? Wrong.\n\nI learned that willpower is like a battery‚Äîit runs out. Sure, you can force yourself to wake up early, work out, or eat clean for a few days, but eventually, your reserves will deplete, and you‚Äôll revert back to old habits.\n\nHere‚Äôs an analogy that helped me understand this:\n\nImagine you‚Äôre thrown into a pit with 50 other people, all heavily armed with body armor, rifles, and night vision goggles. You, on the other hand, have nothing but a tiny knife. Your chances of surviving that fight are slim to none.\n\nRelying solely on willpower is like being that person in the pit‚Äîit‚Äôs an uphill battle you‚Äôre almost destined to lose.\n\nSo, I stopped relying on raw willpower and started equipping myself with better tools.\n\n# 2. I Built Systems\n\nThe most important shift I made was creating systems that removed the need for constant decision-making and made discipline automatic.\n\n# System 1: A Routine\n\nI started organizing my day into a routine. Every activity‚Äîworking out, studying, eating, and even relaxing‚Äîhad a specific time slot.\n\nWhy does this work?\n\n1. **It removes decision fatigue:** Constantly debating whether to go to the gym, study, or scroll on your phone is mentally exhausting. With a routine, there‚Äôs no debate‚Äîyou just follow the plan.\n2. **It prepares your mind for what‚Äôs coming:** If you know you‚Äôre hitting the gym in 30 minutes, your brain starts to prepare for it. This makes transitioning into the activity much easier.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Remove barriers to action. For example, if I know I need to study after dinner, I set out my books, clean my desk, and know exactly what I need to tackle beforehand. This eliminates excuses and makes starting much easier.\n\n# System 2: A Rulebook\n\nI also created a personal \"code of conduct\"‚Äîrules I don‚Äôt break, no matter what. These are based on patterns I noticed in my life. For instance:\n\n* **Rule: No phone for the first 4 hours of the day**. In the past, I‚Äôd start my day by checking notifications and scrolling through social media. It seemed harmless but would ruin my focus and fill my mind with chaotic energy. Now, I avoid my phone in the morning, and my days are far more productive and peaceful.\n\nYou can create your own rules based on your triggers. For example, if hanging out with a certain friend always leads to bad habits, consider limiting that interaction. Write down your rules, and stick to them like your life depends on it‚Äîbecause in some ways, it does.\n\n# 3. I Switched from Instant to Delayed Gratification\n\nIn my undisciplined days, my life revolved around instant gratification:\n\n* Hours of video games.\n* Scrolling endlessly on Instagram.\n* Eating fast food and snacking whenever I felt like it.\n\nThese activities gave me a quick dopamine hit, but they came at a cost. I felt unmotivated, unproductive, and unhappy. Worse, I craved more of these fleeting pleasures just to feel a baseline level of satisfaction, which created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I discovered the power of delayed gratification:\n\n* The sense of accomplishment after a workout.\n* The satisfaction of completing a productive work session.\n* The happiness that comes from knowing I made progress toward my goals.\n\nUnlike instant gratification, delayed gratification doesn‚Äôt leave you drained or craving more‚Äîit leaves you fulfilled. Over time, I found myself craving these long-lasting rewards instead of the quick dopamine hits.\n\n# What I‚Äôve Learned\n\nDiscipline isn‚Äôt about brute-forcing your way through life. It‚Äôs about creating an environment that supports your goals and adopting systems that make progress inevitable.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling with discipline, ask yourself:\n\n* Are you relying too much on willpower?\n* Do you have a routine or rules that guide your daily life?\n* Are you chasing fleeting pleasures or long-term fulfillment?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts‚Äîwhat strategies have worked for you in building discipline?",

This gets you there, you have belief and faith ad results that doing this gets me that., and it seeps into the subconcious.\n\nTop performers - athletes - talk about routines all the time - not only for practice and development but in pressure situations, the player just falls into, routine, this is my routine, and can get out of his head, away from the nerves by following the routine, becoming almost machine, robot like.  Why?  Because it works.\n\nI also think that, even though a routine is awesome‚Ä¶ you may have to tweak it over time IF and WHEN somehow it begins to bore you or is no longer getting the result - as in, say , working out‚Ä¶you can follow the same routine or schedule but you maube have to make the weights heavier or more intense, sort of thing.   If you are sawing wood and getting results, great but after a while you need to sharpen the saw, or change the blade.\n\nAlso‚Ä¶\n\nAbout gratification, delaying it‚Ä¶\n\nWhen it comes to that, we tend to, in this world of instant on demand everything, build the habit of instant gratificatin and reward‚Ä¶we ingrain it, and often we do it with habits we now wish to cange and it feels so hard, as our brain is now like, wtf, where is it, I wnat it now like you been giving it to me for months and months‚Ä¶and so it feels like a mountain climb or a journey of 1000 miles to STOP that and go forward with delaying gratification.\n\nWhat helps me is to break it all down to ONE.\n\nI don‚Äôt have to delay forever or stop the bad habit forever.\n\nJust one time.\n\nOne day.\n\nOr one hour, at a time.\n\nMy thinking is I can do ONE of just about anything.\n\nSo this approach of ‚ÄúONE‚Äù helps me get things done, as well as stop doing things for ONE hour or ONE day, etc.\n\nThe next day?\n\nIt‚Äôs still ONE.\n\nYesterday is over‚Ä¶.tomorrow is a day away.\n\nNow (the new day) is just ONE again.\n\nIt works pretty good.\n\n\nThanks!"

        "text": "Do you ever find your mind wandering off at the most inconvenient times? Or do negative thoughts creep in before those important moments? Learning how to manage negative thoughts can help unlock your potential. Learn how to effectively manage your thoughts to enhance your life and overall wellbeing.\n\n\nUnhelpful thoughts can be distractions or even destructive forces in our lives. The good news is that you can take control.\n\nYour mind ‚Äì correctly used - is your most powerful ally. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine the possibilities when you can dismiss or replace those counter-productive negative thoughts. By doing so, you can achieve more and experience greater satisfaction in life.\n\n\nTry these strategies to manage those pesky negative thoughts:\n\nCreate space between your ‚Äòself‚Äô and your ‚Äòthoughts.‚Äô Recognise that you can choose whether, or not, to engage with your thoughts. You don‚Äôt focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you‚Äôre driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further. You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. Allow them to simply pass on by. Your thoughts are simply something that you experience. Your ‚Äòself‚Äô has primacy over your ‚Äòthoughts.‚Äô Your ‚Äòself‚Äô defines you ‚Äì your thoughts don‚Äôt.  \n\n\nRecognise that it is your brain‚Äôs nature to produce random thoughts. It‚Äôs the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It‚Äôs always going to give you something to think about. Occasionally, those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they‚Äôre frivolous. Sometimes, those thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts. This is the negativity bias. By recognising fear as an emotional response rooted in our evolutionary past, we can better understand and learn how to manage negative thoughts.\n\n\nMeditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind. The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind. Focus on your breathing. When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing. Notice the changes when you breath out for longer than you breath in. Using such deeply relaxed states therapeutically can take your development to a new level.\n\n\nFocus your attention on a thought of your choosing. You have the potential to think about anything you choose. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, or what you have chosen to accomplish today. When you‚Äôre experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. Recognise that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.\n\n\nApply logic. Poor thinking leads to poor decisions. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do? \n\n\nAre negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You‚Äôre not alone. The human brain will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it. \n\n\nIn the short term, negative thoughts hamper your productivity and focus. Prolonged unhelpful thoughts contribute to chronic stress. Research has shown this can contribute to long-term physical health problems such as cardiovascular issues, weakened immune function, digestive problems, and sleep disturbances. It can also result in psychological issues rooted in anger, anxiety, and depression. Developing a deep insight into how our brain / mind works ‚Äì and how you can apply this - is a key strength of Solution Focused Hypnotherapy: leaving you uniquely equipped to deal with what life will throw at you. This insight forms the basis of living your best life in the short-term and sustaining your wellbeing for the long term.\n\n\nIf unhelpful thoughts persist and impact your well-being, consider seeking support from someone who can help you replace these cycles with positive habits, guiding you towards living your best life.\n\n\nThe key is to focus your attention on what you choose. Recognise your random thoughts for what they are and manage them accordingly.",

I am currently working to save up money for the next year as I look at school, professors, labs, and read about the application process. In undergrad, I was never extremely academically inclined (2.89gpa unfortunately) and was always deathly afraid of presenting in front of people. I swear my mind just blanks and I forget all the knowledge i studied and prepared for. And when it comes to writing papers, I feel like i always get off track and miss the point. I feel like this has also translated into my person life when it comes to telling stories; I always get off topic and forget what I was talking about in the first place lol. I really want to get into grad school but I am so afraid that I will fail and not be good enough. I swore I wasn't going to go back to school for a reason but here I am rethinking about it all. Are there any resources that would help me in either of these areas? Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "I recently began experimenting with new morning routines trying to become more productive and healthy. For a week I was able to go to bed between 9-10pm, wake up at 5am, get a morning workout in, bike to campus, study a lot and repeat. I felt great this week. I would game responsibly for 1-2 hours after coming home, read my book, and repeat. I didn‚Äôt drink until the end of the week, so I got good sleep everyday, exercise, and lots of studying.\n\nHowever that routine is starting to slip. I‚Äôm still trying to go to bed early but it‚Äôs difficult. I try to get at least 7 hours of sleep. The problem occurs when I decide to drink a couple beers on a random weeknight, or play video games way too late, or both. Then I‚Äôll go to bed way too late, I‚Äôll sleep in, and the next day I‚Äôll feel tired and unmotivated. Because of this Ill choose to stay home the next day instead of going to the campus library, and end up getting no studying done since I end up playing more video games, watching TV, playing the guitar, or something else at home. I know that I never get any work done at home, so I know I should go to the library everyday early in the morning, but the whole day ends up being a waste because I decided to randomly drink the night before.\n\nI‚Äôve quit weed and nicotine, but alcohol never seemed to be a problem until now. I only drink 1-3 times a week and wouldn‚Äôt consider myself an alcoholic, but I really want to quit so I can pass all my courses, get into shape, get good sleep, and feel great everyday. \n\nI should also note that I recently started taking accutane, so I really should not be drinking. \n\nHow do I quit or reduce drinking? How can I control myself to stay sober during the week? How can I go to bed early every night?",

Make a daily checklist. Sit down with yourself every Sunday and write out your goals and give your word to yourself that you‚Äôre going to honor them. \n\nTherapy is also a huge one that worked for me.

        "text": "It's simply human nature, but a lot of people (aka the majority) are perfectly happy being mediocre, yet deep down they CRAVE change, and never do anything about it, since they're afraid to rock their little stable boats. Everyone who's ever bettered themselves has experienced this - others shouting a barrage of nonsense your way, asking you why are you doing what you're doing. From my personal experience, the 5 most common questions/statements were:\n\n\\- \"why are you moody and serious all of a sudden, smile more\"\n\n\\- \"why are you in the gym so much bro? come on, one guys night won't hurt ya\"\n\n\\- \"BOOKS!???\"\n\n\\- \"ooooh, look at the new coat and scarf. Mister James Bond over here\"\n\n\\- \"you're staying away from sex? since when are you gay??\"\n\nNow yes, your parents and 2-3 closest friends spewing out stuff like this is likely from a good place, since they know you best and are worried you might be going through something. Everyone else though - it's a combination of jealousy of you, lowkey hatred for themselves, and unhappiness with life in general. \n\nThe best thing to do is keeping your new ways as hidden as possible. Underselling yourself is certainly not good, but keeping an aura of mystery certainly is. If the asinine comments persist, it's time to find a new circle of friends. \n\nYou're improving primarily for yourself. You're improving to feel genuine happiness from within, not fake happiness from outside. Never forget that. ",

        "text": "The title might be common sense, but if you think about what this actually means, the truth is pretty dark. I see lots of young guys on here always posting about how they feel invisible to the world and how they feel worthless. Yet, celebrities who are super rich and famous are always trying their best to remain invisible. Those who have had the experience in the limelight understand how it negatively impacts your life. To get to the point, people only \"respect\" you when they find out what kind of value you provide. I say \"respect\" with quotations, because they don't actually respect you, they just pretend to respect you to get what they want. But for somebody who has never experienced that kind of attention, they may not be aware that people are preying on them in a form disguised as \"respect.\"\n\nI use the example of the young man who is lonely in this case, but I can use a lonely young woman as well. I'm sure most women have had a guy they were talking to who in the end just wanted sex, but he was \"respectful\" and charming up until he got what he wanted. Take someone who is rich, it could be a man or woman. The fact that they are rich they can probably find a companion easily. But likely not for the right reasons. Most people are attracted to the lifestyle this person can provide and not the person who they are. Yet they fake that they \"respect\" you to satisfy their needs, or lack thereof. The sad truth is this is how the world operates. Or maybe I'm just a sad person who has this perspective. Either way, whether you are rich or poor I'm sure most of us have all felt these kinds of things before.\n\nAnyways, for those who may feel like they are not enough. You should maybe reconsider it to be a blessing. Focus on what makes YOU happy. Find fulfillment within, not without. Understand that money is a resource that you need to survive and to provide, it's also important to leave a legacy behind for your family, if you were to pass away do not leave them hungry and with nowhere to go. Being rich is not the issue. It is when you make it known to the world, people all of a sudden treat you with \"respect\". When you didn't have shit, that's when you felt invisible. Do not seek validation. I think the realest thing you can possibly do is to be the richest person in the room without anybody ever knowing. If you build a connection with somebody this way, it's a genuine connection because they do not know who you really are. Most people wear it on their sleeve because they want the \"status\", but status is not inherently positive because it attracts people to you for the wrong reasons. Don't talk too much, mind your business, and focus on being the best version of yourself.",

        "text": "\n Yeah, I don‚Äôt know which attachment style I have, but I do relate to this community. I‚Äôm 23 and have never been in an actual relationship (or at least, I‚Äôve never considered it a relationship or labeled it). I‚Äôve been with people for a few months, and one of two things happens:\n\n\t1.\tThey are very into me, and if I wanted to, it could work out. I fantasize about it working out and picture a future‚Äîblah blah‚Äîbut in the back of my mind, I fear I‚Äôll start feeling differently because it happens sometimes. I think I like someone or convince myself I do, and little by little, a feeling of repulsion starts creeping in. At first, it‚Äôs fine, and then one day‚Äîbam‚ÄîI can‚Äôt be near them and have to end it. And then they push or become possessive and it disgusts and enrages me, I feel like I‚Äôm in a sort of survival mode and have to get away. I don‚Äôt feel anything for them, don‚Äôt miss them, and don‚Äôt care. I only feel a bit bad for them but I normally try to be gentle with them (unless they keep pushing) and a bit sad because I know they would‚Äôve loved me, and I disappointed myself in a way.\n\n\t2.\tThey are into me, but in some shape or form, they seem unavailable or like someone who will not commit to me or who will hurt me. At first, it‚Äôs just like the previous situation, but instead of me having the time to pull away, stuff about them hints to me that it‚Äôs not going to work out‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre moving, don‚Äôt seem ready for a relationship, have trauma, are extremely avoidant, or play hot and cold with me. That‚Äôs when I think, ‚ÄòDamn, if they would just act normal and fully want me, then maybe they would be the one‚Äô (lol ‚Äúthey‚Äùhaha). But in the back of my mind, I wonder, ‚ÄòDo you truly think this person could be the one, or have they just not given you enough for you to run away yet?‚Äô So I tend to latch onto these people for quite a while. It ends up being a scenario where they give me a little bit, and I‚Äôm excited. They give me nothing, I feel terrible. They give me a lot, I like it but kind of freak out and distance myself a little. Then they distance themselves more, and I want them‚Äîand so on‚Äîuntil I sort of leave because I‚Äôm afraid or I‚Äôve found someone else. Unlike in situation #1, I feel a lot, which I both love and hate. I feel horrible and great at the same time‚Äîanxious and excited. It takes a toll on my mental health, that‚Äôs for sure, and causes me to spiral and be a bit toxic, but at least I feel something.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôve always felt not normal and overly anxious when it comes to any type of relationship. I feel very uncomfortable letting people completely in. I can let them in, just not completely. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever been myself. There are things I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôd be able to share, and even though I crave someone who knows me like I know myself, I fear it might not be possible. I also have the thought that I can‚Äôt go through more than one heartbreak. Like, if I‚Äôm going to give my soul to someone, it best be once. I‚Äôm not sure I could or even want to fall in love and do all that jazz more than once.\n\nI think it‚Äôs all made me a bit insecure about romantic relationships. So when I get into something, subconsciously, my main priority is proving to myself that I can be in a committed relationship instead of just enjoying it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm sabotaging stuff or if I‚Äôm just a mess. When I feel a lot, I prefer not feeling anything at all. But when I don‚Äôt feel anything and am apathetic, I want all the feelings.\n\nAny opinions/thoughts? I know the answer is to go to therapy but it‚Äôs not that easy for me right now. Either way, I‚Äôm aware It‚Äôs necessary and will go eventually. ",

Nobody deserves to be cheated on, if she didn't want you, she should have first broken up with you and only after that date other men. It is not you who was immature, but her. Stay focus on yourself and adopt a mindset that you will have someone better at your side, someone more compatible. Also, if nobody celebrates your birthday, celebrate it for yourself.

Massive upheavals happened in my life and proper true self reflection started going on in my brain, things lined up, and with my psychologist it's been a process. And wow. I was an asshole, reached 30 feeling starved for love. From friends, from family, fuck from myself. But it was always there, and it was always pushing me along to be better without me seeing it. With such a massive ego I was toppled, an immature brat of an adult who needed his shit kicked in and to finally grow up. \n\nAll those times I felt like my friends were lying to me? I was right, but the lies were there because they *knew* me. I felt unseen for years, felt alone, but it was all because of my brain and my ego telling me this. Those lies were because of my behavior and because I wasn't respecting boundaries. However because they actually DID know me for who I am, those lies were so I can understand by myself. And I always did make miniscule changes when I felt that way, because if they were lying to me something must have triggered it. And those lies? It's because I'm more human than I thought, no one wants to hear the truth about themselves, especially someone with an immature ego. I always felt unloved, but telling the truth flat out is only for when it gets to a breaking point, otherwise you need to work on yourself and giving me the chance to do so was a bigger act of love than I realized. Especially putting up with me for all those years.thank you guys, I really fucking love you guys.\n\nMy parents? God where do I start. I know they love me and I know they did their best. Dad.....not so much and I suspect there's some unchecked narcissism there with how he love bombed my mom and married her within three months, especially with how he treated her all those years and was always using the family unit as a self serving vehicle than actual people with their own desires and needs. But mom. Yeah, gotta love that woman. Worked three jobs when dad bankrupted us, stole 10k from me to get a new store open and got scammed out of it, while I was working a job myself. I rented a place in our building, it's a shithole, but my mom is telling me to not even dare to lose it cause you need to live like this for a while. On your own, with your bare hands and whatever money you're making. You lived too comfortably and you needed the push to become your own person. I see the regret in her eyes that she was too soft on me, and that's how I can tell how badly I fucked up by not being the man she tried to raise. I realize now how easy I've always had it because of em.\n\nAnd myself? God where do I start. I always felt like I was unloved, but I'm realizing it's because of that love it's a miracle that I'm still alive. 19yo, dad bankrupted us like I said. We were 3 years without electricity, barely any water. I was hanging out with some fucked up crowds, hungry in my belly and doing anything to keep my parents afloat. But I was never hungry for love, and didn't realize that's what kept me from being in too much trouble. From getting greedy and doing shit like peddling drugs, stealing, or generally thugging it out. I had the ins, I had people who I was hanging out with, and shit even they loved me in a brotherhoodly sort of way, because they always admired that I was with them despite being a straight arrow. Looking back I think it was respect for having the balls to say no and staying firm to my convictions, and I now realize that the convictions were fueled by the love and admiration I had from the other friends, the ones who stuck by me and are still here 16 years later, and from my family. Somewhere along the way I forgot I love myself, forgot to self reflect, and forgot how I got here. And despite being the biggest ego trip known to mankind, or well that's how foolish and petty I feel about my past self, I was guided along the way and was always supported because the people who didn't quit on me or who saw they couldn't use me for their personal gains knew I was a real one deep down, but was troubled by whatever internal demons I was facing. Hell I'm still facing em, but I now know what they look and sound like.\n\nThank you everyone, thank you me, and sorry for everything. 31 isn't a bad age to realize all this, and I still have a couple of lifetimes ahead of me I think. No matter how hard things get, I do think this is a great start to reboot the system and make better on my promises and the love I have received. Thank you, thank you, and thank you again.",

        "text": "Have you ever thought about how many great dancers, entrepreneurs, writers, or restaurants never reach the audience they deserve? \n\nToday, building outstanding skills alone is no longer enough to succeed. Many markets are saturated with talent. Most of them stay unknown, leaving them no other choice than to exchange their passion for a second or third choice.\n\nBut that won‚Äôt be the case for you. After reading this post, you‚Äôll have a new, powerful weapon in your portfolio of success.\n\n**The quality of your success equals the quality of your network.**\n\nTake the music industry as an example‚Äîit's standard practice to pitch your art to labels or individuals who can connect you with others. Today, networking has become easier than ever, as younger generations often shy away from direct contact. However, succeeding in networking requires much more sophistication than simply sending a message online.\n\n**Stand out by becoming a great networker.** \n\nNetworking is a skill that can be learned, even if you‚Äôre an introvert. Cultivate a natural curiosity about what people do in their lives and find ways to connect them with others. It's a combination of courage, preparation, and persistence. There's tons of free information online to help you become an excellent networker. Practice makes the master.\n\n**Focus on the skills of the future.**\n\nLeaders of the World Economic Forum predict that creativity, empathy or curiosity will be among the most demanded skills of the future. While these qualities may seem vague, they are key to standing out in a crowd.\n\n**How do you practice creativity?**\n\nYour emotional state is a key influencer of creativity. If you‚Äôre constantly stressed, it‚Äôs easy to guess how creative you‚Äôll be (hint: not very). However, you can actively cultivate creativity. The *Blue Ocean Strategy* offers a framework of sophisticated questions designed to help you identify new opportunities by activating hidden brain cells.\n\nPersonally, I‚Äôve discovered that the right music, paired with the right environment, puts me in an emotional state where creativity flows effortlessly.\n\n**And now, the most important thing‚Ä¶**\n\nToo much talent is wasted because of one powerful neurotransmitter: dopamine. Entire industries invest billions of dollars to figure out how to make us keep coming back and staying as long as possible with their product or service.\n\nWe need to understand that overstimulation of dopamine eradicates our desire to work toward what's meaningful to us.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, and some of you might feel defensive. Yet, none of us wants to look back and tell our children about the countless nights and weekends we spent binge-watching a series.\n\n**Dopamine detoxes are trendy.**\n\nUnfortunately, it's like doing a rehab and then going back to your old environment, where a relapse is guaranteed. The next time you attempt a dopamine detox, ask yourself: **How can I permanently lower my dopamine consumption?**\n\nYour future will be greatly defined by how much control you have over your hunger for dopamine.\n\nAnd now, go out there and conquer the world‚Ä¶ after you‚Äôve finished your current series ·µïÃà",

The fact that you recognize the hurt your actions have caused those around you is a good sign that you have at least some degree of self awareness and empathy, since you care to fix the relationships. I think your best bet with them is to sincerely apologize without expecting forgiveness from them. (To be honest, you may never receive forgiveness from some of them, but it sounds like it‚Äôs worth a shot.) Maybe even write the apology if you‚Äôre concerned about the delivery. After the apology, you need to explain all the behaviors that you intend to improve or correct. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I did X, and to ensure that doesn‚Äôt happen again, I‚Äôm taking Y steps.‚Äù Finally, put your money where your mouth is. Do the things you say you‚Äôre going to do. They say changed behavior is the best apology you can make. \nIt‚Äôs going to take time. It‚Äôs going to take patience. I‚Äôm guessing you have a bit of a reputation to shake. It‚Äôs possible to do.

        "text": "Today was another lovely day. I woke up early to make myself breakfast but not early enough. I woke up as my grandfather got to working in the bathroom on the plumbing. I also didn't even about it until after eating. There is always tomorrow. One another though was when I made breakfast I tried something new with the eggs. I heard about someone blotting oil on the pan rather than pouring it in. It helps create that barrier so the egg doesn't stick as much and also uses as little as oil as possible. I found it to be extremely successful and was elated that almost no oil was used to make my eggs! I then headed to work and it was honestly great. I am enjoying picking up hours here and there instead of always being there. It wasn't busy due to the rain but it was something to get me moving for a better majority of the day. I talked a lot to the boss's sister about weight loss. I talked to the guy I knew for a while too and he told me he missed me and the things I liked he could also now talk about again. He also said a lot of customers were also asking for me which was nice to hear. I even saw my former boss since the new boss is her father. Today at work I also had some bread pudding as a midday dessert. I wanted to try it and decided on the idea that if something a bit more carb dense was there than if I had it in the middle of the day, then I would have plenty of time to burn it off. It seemed logical and made me feel good.  After that I sat in the car and wrote some stuff down. My cousin and I both contemplated going to the gym. She said no and then I ended up saying no but then said screw it. I want my gains at the gym is what I told her and then she ended up coming too. Her and I ended up doing back and biceps together and because she had such a bad day, I think working out and me joking with her made her much more at ease. Here was my routine:\n\nLat pulldown:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing each time to be 32.5 40 and 47.5 pounds\n\nLat extension:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 35 35 and 35 pounds\n\nTricep pushdown:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 20 25 and 30 pounds\n\nDual pulley row:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing each time to be 27.5 35 and 40 pounds \n\nBicep curls:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing each time to be 15 20 and 25 pounds\n\nRow machine:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing each time to be 40 45 and 50, full amount on each side\n\nAssisted pull up machine:\n4 at 175 lbs\n\n3 at 175 lbs\n\n2 at 175 lbs\n\n14 minutes and 30 seconds of treadmill (Hit stop too early)l:\n4.5 minutes at 3 mph and then 4 minutes at 4 mph. Then 2.5 minutes at 6 mph and then 7 mph for 30 seconds before it was too much. It was another 2.5 minutes of 4 mph to end it with 9 mph for 30 seconds. \n\nIt was a very pushing day for me and I learned more about form again since I haven't done this arrangement of exercises too much. I departed from my cousin and goodness did I pass out for a bit. My back and biceps were killing me but I felt good. I felt committed and that I went despite mentally protesting. I finished off the sandwich ingredients and used lettuce as the top bun of the sandwich. I also enjoyed the change in pace but want more protein again. It is nice to mix things up though and my cheat day tomorrow will be great for that. Here is what I ate today:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n4 eggs, fried - 320 calories (24 g protein)\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\n168 g of orange - ~90 calories (~1.5 g protein)\n\nLunch:\n\n196 g of apple - ~130 calories (~.3 g protein)\n\n1 pierogi - ~65 calories (2 g protein)\n\n~490 g of Antipasto (I think it's more of an Italian Guardiniera - 150 - 200 calories (4 - 6 g protein)\n\nVery hard to calculate. I ate around 3 artichokes and many other veggies. This salad has no meat or cheese so calories drastically decrease. It is all vegetables with some oil and vinegar. \n\nDay Dessert:\n\n~54 g of bread pudding - ~100 calories (~2.1 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n1 slice of toast - 100 calories (3 g protein)\n\n32 g of peanut butter - 190 calories (7 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n¬Ω cup chocolate milk - 70 calories (6.5 g protein)\n\n1 slice of bread - 80 calories (3 g protein)\n\n5 g of Creamy Horseradish - 10 calories\n\n15 g of cheese - ~55 calories (~2.7 g protein)\n\n51 g of deli turkey breast - ~65 calories (~11.8 g protein)\n\n14 g of lettuce - 3 calories (.17 g protein)\n\n225 g of tomato - ~70 calories (~1.9 g protein)\n\nSBIST was just hearing my cousin tell me I made her day after she had a really bad one. I hated that her day did not go great so I tried to fill it in with jokes and laughter. Going to the gym together and pushing out the negative emotions helped the both of us. Then hearing her say that just made me feel really good. I wasn't really trying since I always try to mess with her and make stupid cracks and remarks. It made my day hearing that and I was already having an amazing one. I wasn't trying to toot my own horn here. Just happy that I have people that make me feel this way. \n\nTomorrow my plan is mostly to enjoy my cheat day and try to weigh in. The bathroom being taken over and me forgetting to get in early took over those plans. That's okay though. A day or two of not weighing in won't kill me and the weight won't change that much. Probably will be worse after my cheat day though. Besides that I'm watching my grandparent's dog while they are away for their anniversary. She's a pretty tame baby so she doesn't really need much watching. It used to be my mom's dog before she didn't want her. I even named her so it's nice seeing her. I have a few errands to run as well so it will be a semi busy day. Thank you my conjurers of the good doggies. You have been man's best friend for so long and hopefully you continue to be. \n",

It sucked, I'm off it but it sucks. I have severe adult ADHD (the inattentive kind) and my life kind of spiraled out of control from there. Lost my career, stopped taking care of myself (grooming, basic hygiene ect). Ended up traumatizing myself by taking on too much and was metaphorically catatonic for a year and a half. I'm stuck. I can't even find the will to brush my teeth. I have a job opportunity that may lead to something and I'm conflicted because I don't know if I should put my pride aside and prioritize my physical wellbeing over my mental one by getting back on the meds that genuinely helped me. I want to emphasize that I'm still hellbent on figuring my stuff out without adderall. I'm just faced with a life altering opportunity and I must have a clear head if I'm to thrive. ",

But what troubles me is our inherent inability to do it without external assistance. It's as if nature/God/whatever didn't find it very important for us to be able to see ourselves without external help. \n\nI think about my past and find that not only are events warped beyond recognition but 90% of it no longer even exists within my head. In depth, serious self reflection becomes impossible without the aid of journals, and other man made tools. \n\nIt's impossible for us to even purely observe our own faces! Either we must deal with the reflected image cast by glass or the warping effects of a camera. \n\nInfact the only ones with a pure view of your face, is everyone and everything except you! How crazy is that? This extends beyond appearances to behaviors, personality traits, talents, etc. \n\nThe world is structured so that learning more about yourself is best done by asking anyone but yourself.\n\nThis is why self-reflection is flawed, it doesn't account for the inherent \"warping\" of information about ourselves from ourselves. To improve we must be willing to not only accept the critique and suggestions of others, but often we must prioritize it over our own judgements.",

        "text": "For the longest time, gossip felt like an innocent way to connect with others. It was normal for me and my friends to chat about whoever wasn‚Äôt present, sharing the latest bits of drama or laughter. But I reached a point where I started noticing how my relationships seemed superficial, almost transactional. It dawned on me that rather than bringing us closer, gossip was keeping us at a distance, feeding off negativity.\n\n  \nTaking the plunge to stop engaging in or spreading gossip wasn't easy. At first, my friendships felt the strain. Conversations stalled, and awkward silences crept in where juicy tidbits used to fill the gaps. However, I realized those moments were opportunities to forge deeper connections. Discussing ideas, dreams, and actual personal interests rather than the lives of our peers created more authentic bonds.\n\n  \nThe transition was gradual but eye-opening. I noticed a shift in how I viewed others and myself. There's something liberating about no longer judging or fearing judgment in the absence of gossip. It's a simple change but hugely impactful. I now surround myself with friends who share my values or, at least, respect my choice‚Äîand that's a community worth building.",

I then considered I might have ADHD and am currently taking 28 Methylphenidate ER tablets, which I don't feel is doing anything either and is just making me irritated and anxious.

Switch things up, try martial arts, talk with your parents more(I know that might not sound fun but learning to make your family some of your best friends is one of the best ways to honor the life you are presently in and they might need you to). therapy is useful but it's hard to tell these days how much therapy is needed and on top of that, it's really up to you to sort of acknowledge that there are things you \"aren't\" doing that would probably help if you were just honest with yourself, but on the flip side of that, you are so young, so how could you possibly know? The way you find out is by trying new things! Safely of course.\n\nKeep going and act with good intention and you'll figure it out. It's okay to spend a lot of time playing video games but being that you are recognizing this, try going outside for a walk! Try all the silly cliche things people describe if only because there is a lot of evidence that it at the very least helps. Ask the adults and other people who care in your life if they have been through similar things and you'll probably realize that most of what you are going through is just life, its not the greatest response to hear but it's the truth of the existence we live in and you're just getting started, hell, arguably not even on the world stage yet, no offense.\n\nKeep trying things with your healthcare professionals, be honest and vocal about what you are experiencing. Especially concerning how the meds are making you feel. You might not feel like you are doing things right, but you are never doing it wrong. It is all a practice of learning through experience and this is a life long journey. You don't need to stress yourself out about where you are going yet. Just focus on trying your best to look for things you enjoy and add on from there, slowly.\n\nand most importantly.....Never Give Up!\n\nYou got this."

We learn the best from mistakes, but only if we allow ourselves to do that and not let ourselves getting discouraged by failing.\n\nI play backgammon at a high level. It is a board game of skill like chess, but additionally there is an element of chance. It has taught me to lose better than anything else in my life. But the thing is, we eventually define ourselves what 'losing' or 'failing' is. For me in backgammon it means that if I lose a match, it is just one match. I will keep playing 99 more matches. And if I were to lose all of them, I will keep playing 999 more matches. And so on. What I mean by this is that you can reframe your approach to 'failing' by moving the goalposts on and on, therefore refusing to quit.\n\nSo you failed your test. It is okay. Go through it and learn from your mistakes. That is the best way for you to learn. Once again to give you an analogy from backgammon, there are a lot of people who play and play and play, much more than I do, but they do not improve. Why is that? Because they never go through their mistakes."

Milton Hershey had failed companies before he founded The Hershey Company.  The Ford Motor Company has had failures, so has General Motors along with many other companies.  I've had failures in life.\n\nI used to study the martial arts and was a tournament competitor for a few years.  I've had times where I thought I would have won in a division I entered only to not win that day.  I remember one time at the first school I trained at we had to break boards as part of our rank test.  One of the tests I think it was either in the green belt or blue belt ranks I had to break a pine board with a knife hand or chop if you want a easier visual.  There were three of us and none of us broke the board of the first attempt and it took me probably about ten times before I broke the board and I got promoted with my right hand and wrist swollen from hitting the board so much.\n\nAnother one was that I had some health issues in my early 20's until my early 30's.  There were times where I just wanted to give up and tell myself that I wasn't going to get healed and that I would always be dealing with the problems for the rest of my life.  However despite all the sets back I had despite all that I went through I knew one day I have my chronic wounds healed and kept going through failed surgery after failed surgery where the last one I had in April of 2017 was finally successful and in July of 2017 I was fully healed not having an open wound for the first time in 11 years.\n\nI've failed on other things but I kept going until I got it right.  Maybe its from my martial arts training that I developed a fighters heart that I still have all these years later.  I'm mostly a failure at dating but I keep trying because I know I will eventually be successful at it.\n\nSo is failure the end of the world?  No, but what is important if you LEARN from what happened.  It took me having two failed dating relationships to learn to not be selfish with the people I date.  Falling for a romance scam and losing a lot of money was a failure of me to listen to my gut and others when they tell me something was wrong.  So don't give up learn from what happened and makes corrections so that you limit your chances of it happening again.  There is a saying I like to use when it comes with failure \"We learn something after we fall flat on our faces.\""

The real cause in most of your suffering is that you are actively trying to suppress your emotions, which you cannot do, and you end up reinforcing them. What you need to learn to do little by little is how to accept living with the physical uncomfortable sensations they evoke. There is no other way around it. Everything you try to do for it just ends up making the problem worse. I know this by personal experience and it has took me a long time to learn it, because it is so instinctual for us to try to resist the pain. But once we learn to accept it, it will eventually subside on its own.\n\n  \nTRE exercises might also be helpful for you so that they could help you to release the tension locked inside of your body.

You know, those ‚ÄúAI geniuses‚Äù that claim they‚Äôll fix your entire life by scheduling your day to perfection. At first, I was like, ‚ÄúYES, finally, someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwill save me from my procrastination spiral.‚Äù But now? I‚Äôm not so sure.  \n**Why It Feels Amazing (At First)**\n\n* **Brain off, productivity on:** These apps plan *everything*. I don‚Äôt even have to think about when to work, eat, or breathe.\n\n* **Time-blocking magic:** It‚Äôs oddly satisfying to see my day chopped into neat little chunks. Like, ‚ÄúWow, look at me being so adult.‚Äù\n\n* **No more excuses:** Missed that deadline? Can‚Äôt blame it on bad planning anymore‚Äîthe AI has receipts.\n\n**Why It‚Äôs Also Kinda... Stressful**\n\n* **The ‚Äúhyper-efficiency trap‚Äù:** When your day looks like a Tetris game of tasks, even a 10-minute delay feels like the world‚Äôs ending.\n\n* **AI ‚â† human:** Sometimes I want to work *outside* the ‚Äúfocus block‚Äù or skip my scheduled stretch session. The app doesn‚Äôt get it‚Äîit just shames me with notifications.\n\n* **Dependency vibes:** If these apps disappeared tomorrow, I‚Äôm 98% sure I‚Äôd spiral. Like, do I even remember how to prioritize without a robot?\n\n**So... Helpful or Harmful?** Honestly, I‚Äôm torn. On good days, these apps make me feel like a productivity god. But on bad days, they‚Äôre just another thing reminding me how ‚Äúunoptimized‚Äù my life is.  \n  \n**Let‚Äôs Settle This** Have AI task managers actually changed your life? Or are they just a high-tech way to stress us out in new, creative ways?Also, real talk: if you‚Äôve cracked the code to making these things work without losing your mind, please share. I need wisdom.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI‚Äôve been on a self improvement journey for around 6 months now and have been able to make some pretty big changes in my life for the better. Some of those things include starting therapy, no more alcohol, communicating more effectively with my wife, drinking more water, eating cleaner, started taking Prozac, significantly reduce marijuana consumption (still working on completely axing it but I have been allowing myself to do it on weekends), and some other things.\n\n Overall, I am definitely better, but I continue to have one significant struggle. I cannot get myself out of the mindset that I am going to fail before I ever even try something that I view as being difficult. And if I do mustard up the strength to try, I usually half ass it and end up failing, which just cements my original belief that I was going to fail. All of the improvements that I have made in my life are things that I viewed as being ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, and the only reason I had not been doing those things previously was because I didn‚Äôt see the point or realized how it was impacting my life. An important distinction is that I am very aware that what I view as being easy/hard is completely subjective. And what I have been able to accomplish, many would find being extremely difficult. \n\nA prime example where this has been most pertinent in my life is my professional career. I have done fairly well for myself but I do not enjoy my work at all. I constantly feel like I am failing and feel completely incompetent. I‚Äôve been able to battle through it before, but recently it has gotten so bad I just get stuck in a paralysis and can‚Äôt do anything.  I tell myself that getting a new job would help, but I have beaten myself into thinking that there is nothing that I am good at. I can‚Äôt get myself to work harder or figure out ways to acquire new skills because I just assume I‚Äôm going to suck at it. And as mentioned, even if I do try, it typically doesn‚Äôt go well for me which I only let reaffirm my original belief that I am failure. \n\nIt is extremely difficult because the logical part of my brain is working. Objectively, I know I am not a complete failure. I have come a long way from where I was at mentally a year ago. I was in a place of self hatred, which I have been able to overcome. I am now more in a state of self disappointment/ frustration. I try telling myself that I can accomplish this/ do whatever, but I can‚Äôt get myself to actually believe it. It‚Äôs made finding motivation extremely difficult and I get stuck in this failure mindset. It feels like all I do is wallow in self pity and I can‚Äôt stand pitying myself, yet it‚Äôs all I do. Constantly making excuses for myself. I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs hard to explain. I have tried articulating this to my therapist (who is great, she has helped me tremendously) but I just don‚Äôt feel like I have made any progress at all in this. Has anyone found themselves in a similar place? What were you able to do to overcome it?",

                "body": "The words 'fail' and 'lose' are words that our brains give meanings, and because the brain wants to protect itself from situations it sees as threats, it wants to prevent from entering into those situations at all. Since your mind and body are in a tense and overstimulated state, your brain naturally reacts into it.\n\nFor me personally the biggest way to learn to let go of losing was when I started playing backgammon. It is a board game that is a game of skill like chess, but additionally it has an element of randomness, meaning that you can play mathematically optimally but still lose. And playing backgammon has really taught me to lose and how to deal with it. It is inevitable, you can only do your best so far, but as you keep doing it for long enough, it will give you results. Nowadays I play competitive backgammon at a pretty high level and just smile if I lose. If I did my best, that's enough. Because I also reframe the concept of losing. If I lose a match, it is just one match and I will keep playing 99 more. If I were to lose all of them, then I will just play 999 more. And so on.\n\nYou do not obviously need to play backgammon, but my point is that perhaps you need to have some area in your life where you can reframe your approach to failing. Hobbies that give you joy would probably be good for that."

The fact that this is still a taboo topic in many circles‚Äîdespite us living in a supposedly progressive era‚Äîis ridiculous.\n\nIf more successful people, especially women in high-powered roles (CEOs, politicians, celebrities, etc.), openly admitted to enjoying masturbation, it would shatter the stigma. People would realize that liking sex or porn doesn‚Äôt make you weak, unprofessional, or less of a human being.\n\nInstead, embracing your sexuality can be empowering, healthy, and even contribute to a balanced life. I think it‚Äôs time we stop treating masturbation like a shameful secret and start treating it as what it is: a normal, human thing.",

        "text": "\nEvery day, life presents me with choices‚Äînot just about what to do or where to go, but about how to see the world. It‚Äôs easy to let my thoughts spiral, to feel weighed down by what‚Äôs missing, what‚Äôs out of my hands, or what might happen tomorrow. But I‚Äôve realized that happiness isn‚Äôt about the events that occur; it‚Äôs about the habits of my mind.  \nIf my mind is conditioned to focus on the negative‚Äîto complain, to dwell on scarcity, or to worry‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep living in a loop of dissatisfaction. But if I train my thoughts to lean toward gratitude, control, and presence, I‚Äôll see the world differently. Life, then, becomes brighter, softer, and more forgiving.  \nSo, I commit to these three decisions every single day:  \n1. Focus on what I have, not what's missing. \nGratitude is powerful. When I pause to notice the blessings in my life, the things I‚Äôve been overlooking‚Äîthe little joys, the kindness I‚Äôve received, the lessons I‚Äôve learned‚ÄîI realize how much I already have. It‚Äôs not about pretending everything is perfect; it‚Äôs about shifting my gaze. Instead of chasing after the next big thing or lamenting what‚Äôs not there, I‚Äôll nurture what‚Äôs already here.  \n2. Focus on what I can control not what I can't.\nThere will always be storms I can‚Äôt stop, challenges I can‚Äôt predict, and people I can‚Äôt change. But I can always choose my response. My energy is better spent on the things within my control‚Äîmy actions, my thoughts, my effort. This shift feels liberating. I‚Äôm learning to let go of battles that aren‚Äôt mine to fight and pouring my energy into the areas where I can make a difference.  \n3. Focus on the present, no on the past or the future.\nThe present is where life is happening. Yet, so often, I find myself trapped in regrets about the past or worries about the future. Neither of these places is real anymore; they only exist in my mind. Today, I choose to anchor myself in the now. To savor the taste of my morning coffee, to feel the warmth of the sun on my face, to hear the laughter of loved ones. Life becomes fuller and more meaningful when I slow down and simply BE.\n\nThese three decisions are simple, but they‚Äôre not always easy. They require practice, patience, and forgiveness for the times I fall back into old habits. But I know they have the power to transform how I experience life.  \n\nToday, I choose gratitude over scarcity.  \nI choose focus over frustration.  \nI choose presence over worry.  \n\nAnd as I keep choosing, day after day, I believe my perspective‚Äîand my life‚Äîwill keep changing for the better.

Ofc don‚Äôt be ok wit EVERYTHING in life because for example u don‚Äôt wanna be ok wit ppl getting hurt, but u can be ok wit a lot of things prolly that u think r just so BAD rn. \nIf u r ok instead of have a problem wit something, then u have no problems in life, n therefore no unhappiness. \n\nSo I would encourage u to instead of having a problem wit something, be ok wit that thing.

        "text": "I want to illustrate my point as to why you should talk to at least 3 strangers, daily, completely unplanned and unprepared:\n\nAbout a week ago, I took a bus home from work, and I was standing in the middle of the vehicle beside an older man. He's about 60, still has most of his hair, tall, in shape, and youthful looking. What's funny is that we both wore the same outfit, just in different colors; I had on a brown coat and brown loafers with a black turtleneck and jeans, while he had a grey checkered coat and pants with a brown turtleneck and loafers. He had shades on while I had my reading glasses on.\n\nI noticed this, so I leaned over to almost whisper to him, as the whole bus was quiet af for some reason. I told him \"I must say sir, immaculate outfit.\" He was completely taken aback, mouth wide open with a big smile, and he simply said \"likewise young man, likewise.\" We chatted for about 3 minutes about fashion and how to stay fancy-looking during fall and winter. Before he got off he thanked me for making his day, and hoped that I had a wonderful day too, as we shook hands.\n\nThen yesterday, I was approaching a bus to get on, and this elderly man was waiting too. He was about 70, maybe late 60's, decked out in an old-school brotherly Kappa tracksuit and one of those rare Eurosport jackets, with a baseball cap on naturally. He looked like one of those \"I've had a hard life, but I became tougher out of it\" types, which I liked immediately. I told him to go in before me, but he refused and told me to go instead. \n\nI refused, and we went back and forth a few times, before he finally said \"you were raised right, kid\", with a stern but honest smile. This time, I was taken back, so I responded by saying \"well, they tried\" through a smile, but he shut this attempt at self-deprecation down quickly by saying my parents didn't fail. He grabbed my forearm as he said this, and almost gave me a respectful bow before finally entering the bus. This time, my day was made.\n\nDaily interactions like this not only broaden your social skills and earn you new friends potentially, but they can make your day and someone else's too. Do it!",

Regarding the porn, trust me I've been there, thinking about it, getting those urges are all a part of the journey. I actually took a tough approach by becoming a bit hard on myself, trying to suppress those urges and going cold turkey whenever they popped up. You might want to give it a try if none of the other methods have worked for you, but the key step in any approach is to not give in to those urges, with time they become much more easier to manage."

Over time, it can train your brain to crave more of that quick, intense dopamine hit, which makes it hard to stop.\n\nOne thing that can help is understanding the cycle you‚Äôre in. Ask yourself: when do you usually feel the pull to watch porn? Is it boredom? Stress? Curiosity? Identifying those triggers can give you a better sense of what‚Äôs driving the habit.\n\nInstead of focusing on just stopping, try redirecting that energy. For example, when you feel the urge, can you shift into a different activity that you genuinely enjoy?

We've been together for 5 years, and while we have our ups and downs, she keeps me grounded and helps me as much as she can. We do want to move in together, get engaged, etc.\n\nMy biological parents did drugs while pregnant with my brother and I, and tried to abort us. We were born at five months, and thankfully I escaped relatively unscathed. I do see a therapist now, and take medicine for my chronic depression and ADHD.\n\nThis is where the \"me feeling like a failure\" part comes in. Being 37 years old, I feel like I'm so late to start life. I did finally settle on a career path, and a goal to finish my AS, then my BS. I'm currently in school to finish my AS, but I'm failing two classes right now. I made school such a priority and told myself \"you cannot fail, failure is not an option.\" However, I feel so low right now.\n\nI want nothing more than to live the life I deserve, and to be happy. I want to feel free, and to escape the narcissistic clutches of my mom. I'm working on things, and trying to make things better for myself, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm a failure, and worse than that, that I don't even deserve to exist in the first place, mostly due to me feeling so aimless and directionless my entire life.

I feel like when it comes to basic motor skills and simple proficiency with the hands, I'm far below average. For example folding, cutting, taping, knowing hjow to put things in certain ways, etc. Additionally, my ability to just think and grasp the situation with the roller coaster and to provide suggestions and ideas and criticism is just not there. It's like my group members instantly had something pop in their mind whenever a question was asked, or whenever they thought of something, but my mind is simply blank. I hate how subpar and subhuman I feel compared to others. I don't know what went wrong in my upbringing for me to not even be average, to be subpar. Genetically, my mom is good with her hands and stuff, and my little brother and sister are probably average and normal and can actually contribute to groups. Me on the other hand, I don't know.

                "body": "Ok, here are a few things to do in the present moment right now. When our minds keep going back to a hard or painful time, it can feel really heavy. A good way to focus on right now is to use your senses to bring you back to the present. For example, try the \"5-4-3-2-1\" technique: Look around and name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Another idea is to take slow, deep breaths. Breathe in for four counts, hold it for four counts, and breathe out for four counts. This helps calm your body and mind. You can also try focusing on something simple, like how your feet feel on the ground or the feeling of water when you wash your hands. I sometimes touch my hands together and focus on the sensation of my hands touching while looking at them. These small steps can help remind you that you‚Äôre safe and bring your attention to what‚Äôs happening right now."

        "text": "Today was a good day. A tad boring but still good. It was not as fruitful as the previous day. It was mostly a chores around the house kind of day, a nap, and then getting to the gym. I ended it by watching a Twitch stream after the gym. The real meat and potatoes of it came from the gym. I really pushed myself and felt amazing about it. Hitting that speed on the treadmill felt amazing. It felt like I was really trying to push it and my body was ready for it. I couldn't have been happier afterwards and didnt feel like my body was getting sore. Time will tell with the next day. Here was my workout:\n\n31 minutes on the treadmill:\n4 minutes at 3 mph and then 6 min at 4 mph. Then 3 min at 5 mph. I did 6 mph for 2 min. I rested by doing 3 mph for 6 min and 4 min at 4 mph. Then I did it with 4.5 mph for 1.5 min and 2 min of 6 mph. It was then 1 min of 7 mph and 1 min of 8 mph. Then ended it with 30 sec of 9 mph.\n\n15 minutes on the elliptical \n\nI was so excited at the gym that I watched some stuff when I got home and shortly passed out afterwards forgetting to eat.wWe can just say it was a big deficit day for calories and that is really the only way I can lose weight. I didn't mean to eat that few but that was the heart of the cards. I just hope not to feel the repercussions of it too much. Here is what I ate:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n¬Ω cup chocolate milk - 70 calories (6.5 g protein)\n\n172 g of orange - ~90 calories (~1.6 g protein)\n\nLunch:\n\n225 g of pineapple - 135 calories (~1 g protein)\n\n2 slices of bread - 160 calories (6 g protein)\n\n25 g of Creamy Horseradish - 50 calories\n\n42 g of cheese - 135 calories (10.5 g protein)\n\n141 g of deli turkey breast - ~175 calories (~32.7 g protein)\n\n14 g of lettuce - 3 calories (.17 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n¬Ω cup chocolate milk - 70 calories (6.5 g protein)\n\nSoda of the Week - 200 calories \n\nSBIST was how awesome I freaking felt on the treadmill today. Oh my goodness I got up to such a high speed for myself. I didn't even feel too winded afterwards. I know it wasn't for long but it felt awesome afterwards. I felt very proud of myself for trying it out. It was kind of an in the moment decision to see what it would feel like and I am very happy I tried it out. Hopefully I'm not too sore the next day and I'll make sure to think about whether or not to rest. \n\nTomorrow will be another good day. I have a few more hours of work scheduled and I'm hearing it will be raining. Hallelujah to the rain for filling up the shallow well at my house but that means work may be dead. I don't know what will be like since the shop doesn't have as many working parts now so we will see. I also will be going to work out depending on if my cousin comes. I'll go if she goes and give myself a rest day if she doesn't. Either works for me. I want to rest myself since I keep pushing my boundaries and enjoying it. Also it is my first full day of work in a while so I may already be tired. My weigh in is actually tomorrow and I will be doing that as long as I don't forget and my grandfather doesn't take over the bathroom since he may be coming in the morning. Thank you my conjurers of the alarms. You wake me up in the most desperate of times. \n",

Managing to stop drinking, surfing the web/fapping ( all at once ) at moments in their life's where they really need it in order to achive their goals or when their close to loosing something important or just in real bad place. The stories always talk about people with motivation or struggle or ... something\n\nBut with me ... this is lacking.\n\nThere were many moments in my life where detoxing this rotten brain of mine would have being a good idea. many moments where it was important for me to be focused and in top condition. I did not quit on those moments.\n\nNow I am quitting, and there is nothing particulary moving about it. This is nothing special going on, nothing exactly filling me with the strength or purpose to do it... yet I am doing it.\n\nIt almost feels wrong. It feels wrong that I did not manage to quit on moments where it would have being helpful and significant yet I am managing it now, a rather ordinary moment\n\nYes, I am fully aware what many of you are going to say: \"Unlike fiction and media condition us to subconsciously believe, life does not follow the rules of narrative. Sometimes achievements come in the less ideal of times, sometimes progress is gradual and one manages to go through important hallmarks without even noticing, you are not hero that gets that power up in the climax of the story or on the end of the movies to bring the audience to tears.\"\n\nI am fully aware of all of that. But my brain ( which is a enemy more than an ally most of the times) won't leave me alone with the:¬† \"If you didn't manage that THEM when it was important what says you are going to manage that now? you are relapsing in a few days tops\"¬† and \"Hahah. Great one, dude! Finally managing to get yourself of the hook, and you will get NOTHING of value for it. That is hilarious\"\n\nI Tag this as advice because I want to know : How I make my mind stop?!? How I make it shut up so I can just enjoy it and continue to make progress?!?",

        "text": "Maybe not necessarily but I‚Äôm 22 (M) and currently at uni doing a business degree. \n\nEver since I‚Äôve been at uni, ironically, i genuinely feel like I‚Äôve gotten more stupid. I don‚Äôt find my uni course challenge. I haven‚Äôt scrapped by but I haven‚Äôt really immersed myself into the course. First 6 or so weeks of a semester I do try and go to all my lectures but for example the last couple weeks I‚Äôve gone to none. I have been to the library but still. It‚Äôs mainly to do coursework \n\nI feel like to make this easier to read I‚Äôll just go 1 by 1 the issues I‚Äôm having \n\nI feel like I‚Äôm being general clumsy and stupid. Like I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to describe it. But sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not really on it. Like I‚Äôm not thinking properly. Like for example ask someone something and it‚Äôs just a super obvious thing/answer. Or I‚Äôd be looking for something and it‚Äôs like staring straight at me. Like yesterday I put on a wash for my white clothes and it was like a 6 hour wash for only a couple T shirts and some socks. I live with 4 other mates. And like at the time i didn‚Äôt really think it was a big deal but then looking back and yeah it was such a stupid idea.\n\nI generally feel more stupid. Like I‚Äôd say my general knowledge used to actually be pretty good. Like higher than average. But now I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as good as it was. And uni stuff as well. Like if someone asked me to explain a specific theory or concept I‚Äôd genuinely struggle. Like I feel like nothing stays in my head. I also forget peoples names so bad. Like I went out last night and i genuinely had to ask a guys name like 7 times probably. Like if I meet someone new and they tell me their names, I feel like I forget it instantly. Maybe I‚Äôm not being very attentive\n\nAnother thing, which to be fair I‚Äôve had for a long time before uni‚Ä¶ is me stumbling over my words or not being able to get my words out. And I‚Äôm really bad at pronouncing things. \n\nI feel like I‚Äôm not good at anything. Like I have my hobbies but like I feel like I sort of suck at them all. Or at least not good at them. Like I play a few sports and am bad at them. I play video games and pretty average at them. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm okay at cooking/baking but I more enjoy that over being super good. Like obviously those things are just practice but I also feel I have a lack of hobbies. Like I dont know how to draw. I dont know a second language. I dont play an instrument. I feel like I should have more interests. \n\nI think the last point sort of encompasses the whole problem. Lack of motivation, get distracted easily, procrastinate and a general feeling of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be bothered‚Äù and I think that sentence is the real issue ever since going to uni. \n\nLike my screen time is embarrassingly high. Most days I‚Äôll spend a few hours on Instagram and a few hours on YouTube. At least 6 hours combined. That‚Äôs normally in the morning and at night but even if it‚Äôs 3 hours either way it‚Äôs still a lot. And a lot of the time I‚Äôll wake up be on my phone and be cosy or whatever and just don‚Äôt do anything till 11,12 or 1 o‚Äôclock. And then I sort of sack the day off and just go on my PlayStation. Or a lot of the time when I‚Äôm at the Libary doing course work or lecture stuff I‚Äôll just go on my phone and scroll on instagram for 10 minutes then go back to work for only like 10-15 so I‚Äôm super unproductive. It‚Äôs even bad when I want to watch a 20 minute YouTube video and then a minute or 2 into the video I just go on Instagram reels or whatever.\n\nLike I genuinely think it‚Äôs a real issue but I don‚Äôt know how to stop it. I want to stop being all the things I‚Äôve mentioned. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm depressed because I‚Äôm not really sad. Obviously I have my own issues like I‚Äôm quite insecure about a few things and I have social anxiety. I hate uni for the fact it‚Äôs so unstructured and I feel like there‚Äôs no repercussions for not turning up to a lecture. Least with school. I knew I had to wake up at 7. Get there for 9. Be there till half 3. And I knew i had at least 6-7 hours of brain stimulation and solid hard work and I could go home and relax. I dunno I just need some advice and help. ",

Over the years, I‚Äôve watched him explode on people, punch walls, and just completely lose it.  I‚Äôve tried to help. I‚Äôve told him so many times that he needs therapy or anger management. His answer is he doesn't need help people just push his buttons. Two years ago, he married Sarah, and she is the sweetest, kindest person ever. But honestly, I‚Äôve been worried for her. I‚Äôve seen him yell at her over the dumbest things, like not putting enough salt on his food or something equally unbelievable. \n\nYesterday a friend caled me saying Jake had been arrested for hitting Sarah during an argument. Apparently, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Jake called me from jail, begging me to bail him out.  I said no. He crossed a line, and I‚Äôm done. He flipped out called me a fake friend and said I was abandoning him in his darkest hour.  Since then, his family has been blowing up my phone, saying I‚Äôm heartless and that everyone makes mistakes. Sarah actually reached out to me, thanking me for not enabling him. She told me she‚Äôs planning to leave him for good, and I said I‚Äôd help her however I can.  \n\nNow, I‚Äôm stuck in the middle. Some of our  friends are saying I did the right thing by letting him face the consequences, but others think I should‚Äôve bailed him out because that‚Äôs what friends do.  Honestly, I feel torn. This is someone I‚Äôve known for so long, but I can‚Äôt excuse what he did. Am I a bad person for refusing to bail him out? ",

        "text": "It‚Äôs already evident that the cost of living is rising‚Äîhomes, food, utilities, clothes, and nearly everything else are becoming more expensive. This is largely due to the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target, which is intended to maintain a steady rate of inflation indefinitely. However, the reality is that most jobs don‚Äôt provide annual raises to match this inflation rate. Minimum wage jobs, for instance, are unlikely to see significant pay increases, especially after layoffs or other cost-cutting measures.\n\nAs a result, prices will continue to rise while wages largely stagnate. Some jobs may offer slight increases to keep pace, but overall, most people‚Äôs incomes will not match the growing cost of living. Fast-forward 10 years, and we‚Äôll likely see a situation where everything costs significantly more, yet wages remain the same or only marginally higher. At that point, even basic necessities like food may become unaffordable for many.\n\nPeople often assume governments will step in to address such issues, but current challenges show this is unlikely. Even if they devise solutions, implementing and fine-tuning them would take years. Governments can‚Äôt simply force companies to raise wages without consequences; doing so could lead to fewer jobs being offered or higher prices for goods and services, further exacerbating inflation. On the flip side, abandoning the 2% inflation target could lead to an economic collapse, as the system relies on controlled inflation to function.\n\nIn essence, the current system is deeply flawed. While the 2% inflation target is necessary to keep the economy stable, it‚Äôs also gradually eroding people‚Äôs purchasing power. Eventually, this could lead to widespread dissatisfaction, potentially sparking rebellion or calls for systemic change. History has shown us that while alternative systems exist, none are without their own significant drawbacks.",

        "text": "To straight to the story, I was always been inconsistent in building habits and always procrastinate at work, Until I found this.\n\nNot getting into more of scientific and psychological concept, I will explain you with simple terms\n\nLet's say your age 25. You build a inner-identity for 25 years and also your ego. In all these 25 years you are all in comfort zone and not worrying about to change your lifestyle, and your ego loves that and dreaming that this will last forever. Incase if you tried any activities that leads to breaking out your comfort zone and do good things for your body and mind, your ego hates it.\n\nWhat does this do?, It will pass a strong negative emotion to break your habit streak\n\nFor example lets say you started hitting the gym, It was a good 2 weeks since you joined, but at the 3rd week start you felt tired while waking up. And this is the chance that ego takes to make you quit. It passes negative emotions like \"Bruh, Let's make it on other day\" or \"Gym is not for us, see its been 2 weeks and yet to see the progress, so quit\" etc... Now Here in this situation most of us will give reaction to emotion like \"Yup, Let's quit\", or \"Gym's doesn't go anywhere, lets start again next week fully prep'ed for my month\"\n\n**You Gave reaction to the negative emotion**\n\nYou decided that i would wake up every morning at 5 but after the 3rd day you accidentally slept until 7, Now the ego will send the negative emotion ' Oh god, you break'ed the streak, Let's start from next week, coz... It's already 3 days over in this week...\"\n\nGuys, noticed a common pattern?\n\nWhenever your motivation and striving energy is low (Which is completely normal and happens for everybody somedays), Ego takes the chance and passes its complete negative energy to put you back in normal lifestyle.\n\n**Ok What's the solution?**\n\nThere's one good thing with negative emotions. It doesn't stay with you for more than 10 to 15 minutes. It's like a passing cloud, But in that short period, it will break your momentum completely.\n\n**So we should stop giving reaction to our negative emotions**\n\nNot everybody masters it from the start. It took me 15 days to cross the newbie level. But trust me guys it works.\n\nLet's say you're on a diet. While shopping you notice a newly launched chips pack with tempting flavour. Now Again in this situation Ego see's the opportunity and sends negative emotions like \"**C'mon, its just one packet and doesn't hurt\" \"It has roughly 100 to 200 calories which is under your diet control\"**\n\nNow you should not give a damn about it Just walk the distance by from that pack rack, Mumble something, Sing a song in the mind, or just notice the emotion and ignore or say to yourself \" i am not touching it\". Yes, It's going to be hard, But you will not regret the decision of not reacting to it after the emotion is gone.\n\nAt least rather than reacting to it and feeling guilty of choosing it after. Try this, I am sure this works for everybody.\n\nAnd a small notes, Sometimes in this journey it's ok to fail the streak or to have a bad day. And give yourself a compliment or a reward to every forward step you achieve towards your goal.\n\nPeace :)",

In addition, its antimicrobial qualities help prevent infections on the scalp and encourage healthy hair development. Sulfur helps produce collagen, which encourages the development of new hair follicles. Although it requires a lot of patience, growing hair does not need to be painfully slow. Onion oil benefits by promoting quicker growth and volume...... Some recipes for you to try. 1: Coconut Oil and Onion Juice Mask\nYou will need five drops or two tablespoons of onion juice, coconut oil, and tea tree oil. Blend all the components well and massage the mixture onto your scalp. Leave it on your scalp for around 30 minutes, and rinse your hair with a mild shampoo.....\n2: Olive Oil and Onion Juice\nMix onion juice and olive oil thoroughly to prepare this hair oil. Apply this mixture to your scalp and use circular motions to massage it gently. After around two hours, wash your hair with a gentle shampoo. Try this remedy every alternate day......\n3: Egg and Onion Juice Hair Mask\nTo prepare this mask, you will need onion juice, 2-3 drops of rosemary/lavender essential oil, and an egg. Whisk the egg and onion juice together, and massage the mixture down the length of your hair and scalp. Hold off for 20 to 30 minutes. Use a mild, sulfate-free shampoo when washing your hair. Repeat this routine once or twice a week......\n4: Onion Juice Mask with Potatoes\nBlend 2 tablespoons of potato juice and onion juice. Apply this mixture to your scalp and massage for about 10 minutes gently. Then, rinse your hair with a soft shampoo......\n5: Lemon and Onion Juice Mix\nAdd one tablespoon of onion juice and one tablespoon of lemon juice and blend them well. Apply this mixture to your scalp and massage it gently. Keep this oil on for around 30 minutes, and then use a soft shampoo to wash your hair. You can try this twice a week..... Before using onion juice on your hair, conduct a patch test to rule out any adverse responses."

Avoiding things just confirms to your brain that you should be scared of everything because everything is dangerous.

Over time it will prove to your brain that you CAN handle these things and they become less scary over time. I feel you though on the part about speaking up even when you‚Äôre right. I deal with that constantly, I think it just shows that you‚Äôre a good person though because you don‚Äôt feel the need to prove that you‚Äôre always right and stuff.

You can really use one now! One won't hurt! Will you be the servant to that stupid scale, or be a real man and take what you want?\"\n\nIn the other case, the tone is calmer, the language is less hyperbolic, it all feels more like a friend who is trying to find a good solution for both of us: \"So, the scale says that we are doing pretty well, the glucometer says the same thing. But we had an ice cream last week, and in general it won't help you in the long run. On the other hand, you can afford it and it won't be too bad, you didn't indulge too much this week, and we agree that a bit of indulgence is okay sometimes. It's up to you. No pressure, take your time!\"\n\nInteresting to realize. I wonder if one could work on transforming one voice into the other, so to make better, more rational and productive decisions.",

I don't think I even fell off, but rather I was always bad and growing up has exposed my flaws.¬†\n\n\nNow, I've decided to just set horribly low, easy goals for every month and add them up one at a time. Last month I started with body language/making eye contact with people. It sucks, but I've been doing it now. I found that as long as I put on a confident front, most people don't know/care how much of a bad person I really am.¬†\n\n\nI do this because as long as I do that one thing for the month, I can excuse everything else and stop beating myself up over it. I still do a ton of bad stuff, but at least I'm making a little progress, even if it's not as much as I should be doing. It's better than telling myself I'll lock in and change everything, and then doing nothing.

        "text": "Here's the story:\n\nSo there are about 2-3 events that led up to this bullcrap so hear me out\n\n1: I remember this time where I got so mad after one of my friend(we don't really hang out that much) pulled my shorts down in front of my whole friend group(or most of them), and I got so pissed that I started to rage, I was swearing at him, was acting a lil goofy with the anger, slapped his knee tryna act tough, and threw my bag across, picked it up again and smashed it onto the floor. \n\nWhen I threw my bag across, my cologne feel out any my computer, both of them were broken, my cologne smashed, and computer damaged. Cuz of my over reaction(should've taken it as a joke) I felt like I kind off ruined my reputation for a lil while.\n\n2: Here's the worst bit: So I have this good friend(we'll call him john, we had great times together and is kinda popularish), john was dating this girl and after several times he told me that I should stop talking to his girl, I kept doing it, kept talking after warning after warning, i sat with her in class when he had a diff class, hanged out with her in a mall(2x) when he was gone, and after there probs was a clip of me hanging out with her, and \n\nthat was it, he had heard enough and wanted to bash me(or had intentions doing so)\n\n3. We were on a call with my other friends, and he was on their too, I wasn't taking the whole thing seriously, I was also being a wussy when they were talking bout fights. School day came and in the gym locker my n my whole frined group were there same with John(he's also pat of the friend group) said \"c'mon i'm right here, have a go on me\" I didn't wanna fight cuz this man tall as hell, and I said \"Nah\" and left while every1 was saying \"oooh'. \n\n4. I ditched all of em and blocked them cuz I hated them then, they did care some of em, but I ditched them for too long that they don even care now, I try to hangout with some of em now(with the whole friend group present) and it just doesn't feel the same(thye I guess tease me more often and have lil to no respect for me), john I guess just let it slide now cuz I haven't hanged out with his girl in ages and learnt my lesson from it, but the lasting impact I made, I feel like my reputation is bad n i irrelevent, I used to have a good reputation in the whole friend group, I was treated with respect and ppl loved me. Now it's the f\\*cking opposite hate that shi. I'm tryna fix these relations with my friends but I also feel degraded and feel like I got low self worth brah.\n\nWhat the hell do I do now? I wanna be seen as someone who is respectable. Some of my friend's actually treat me good now but I think it's like 50% secrettely hate and 40% don hate.\n\nGoin to college next year so yehh.",

        "text": "We humans are creatures of habits. We tend to keep doing the same things, following the same patterns.  \nIn a way, our habits and routines are part of us, but they also define who we are. They shape our lives and identities.  \nRoutines and habits can either make or break us. They can enslave us, or serve as enablers, catalysts.\n\n> At the end of the day, you are a combination of your habits and the people who you spend the most time with ‚Äî Naval Ravikant\n\n# Self-awareness is key to personal growth\n\nWhich habits and routines are key in your life? Which ones are valuable, and which ones are negative or even toxic?\n\nPaying attention to your own patterns of behavior is important. It enables self-awareness, becoming conscious of, changing and improving. It enables letting go of the negative ones, and doubling down on the positive ones. This self-knowledge is thus key to personal growth.\n\nBy being conscious of your habits, routines and patterns, you will be able to live a more intentional life. A life that you design to serve your goals.\n\n> You fall to the level of your systems and habits\n\nSystems and habits are what give you consistency to make long term changes. If those are inexistant, or weak, then so are you.\n\nIt's not only about productivity and optimization. It's more profound than that. First and foremost, it's about alignment, health, and happiness.\n\nBy designing the life you want, you can reduce stress, grow, improve your relationships, feel healthier and happier.\n\n# Key areas to explore and questions to ask yourself\n\nHere are the key areas you need to think about and explore:\n\n* Routines (morning, work, evening, etc)\n* Health habits\n* Self-care practices\n* Leisure activities\n* Relaxation methods\n* Harmful behaviors\n* Stress management\n* Things to start doing\n* Things to stop doing\n* Decision-making\n* Personal development\n* ...\n\nReflecting on these areas can provide a good view of your daily life and habits, helping you identify areas for change and growth.\n\n> People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures ‚Äî F. Matthias Alexander\n\nHere are a few questions that you can use as prompts to learn more about yourself:\n\n* What do you do in the morning? What are the first things on your mind?\n* How do you spend your work days?\n* What do you do in the evening? How do you end your days?\n* What are your sleep habits and bedtime routines?\n* What are your weekend routines like? How do they differ from weekdays?\n* How do you spend your leisure time?\n* How do you prepare for the week ahead?\n* How do you take care of yourself?\n* How do you relax?\n* How do you take care of your health?\n* What habits do you have around personal grooming and self-care?\n* What rituals or routines do you have around meals?\n* How do you harm yourself?\n* How do you handle stress or difficult emotions?\n* What do you regret in your life?\n* What do you need to start doing?\n* What do you need to stop doing?\n* How do you manage your finances and spending habits?\n* How do you approach learning and personal growth?\n* What habits do you have around technology and media consumption?\n* How do you celebrate accomplishments or milestones?\n* What spiritual or mindfulness practices do you engage in, if any?\n* How do you approach goal-setting and planning?\n* What habits do you have around your living space (cleaning, organizing, etc.)?\n* Do you spend time in nature or outdoors?\n* What creative outlets or hobbies do you regularly engage in?\n* What are your social habits? How often do you connect with others?\n* How do you give back or contribute to your community?\n* What habits do you have around travel or exploring new places?\n* How do you approach decision-making in your life?\n* What are your core values?\n* What are your principles?\n* How do you approach work?\n* How do you make career decisions?\n* ...\n\n# Redesign your life regularly\n\nI'm a huge fan of periodic reviews (i.e., daily/weekly/monthly/yearly meetings with yourself). I've often mentioned it in my writing. Doing this exercise a single time is not enough. Life design is an ongoing activity. We evolve, the people around us evolve, society evolves. Everything changes. Change is the only constant. So, make sure to regularly evaluate the way you live your life, and identify new opportunities for change. Take risks. Embrace change.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt's all too easy to live on autopilot, and wake up one day, feeling disconnected from your own existence. The habits and routines that make you who you are often operate in the background, shaping your days and ultimately your life without much conscious thought.\n\nBy bringing awareness to the habits and routines that make you who you are, you can start to shape your life more intentionally. This process of self-discovery and intentional living can lead to a more fulfilling and purpose-driven existence, where you're actively participating in creating the life you want, instead of just following the path in front of you. Break free from this autopilot mode and take control of your life's direction. Live more mindfully. Be more self-aware. Design your own life and career.\n\n> Your habits will determine your future ‚Äî Jack Canfield\n\nThat's it for today! ‚ú®",

As I started getting into my late teens I did something about it.\n\nI worked on 'me'. I made sure that I was a decent guy and not a dick.  I didn't buy designer labels because that didn't work for me but I bought clothes that suited me and  were well fitting and kept clean..just jeans, t-shirts and a few pairs of trousers and shirts. I made sure I smelled good, just some basic deodorant and body spray and a bit of aftershave\n\nI went to the gym...nothing major, just a few hours per week and made sure I was not 'unfit'.\n\nI listened to and watched comedy and learned what made people genuinely laugh without being overly obscene.  I learned to be able to talk about what's relevant and treat people how THEY wanted to be treated \n\nBasically I got a personality that made up for height and looks and took a genuine interest in others.\n\nI'm 53 now.  I've had two long-term relationships with  amazing women and produced a couple of great daughters.  I've had male and female friends come and go over the years who all though I was great company and wanted me as part of their lives because of what I bought to the table...nothing to do with looks or height.\n\nPrior to and in between  my LT relationships, I have had a LOT of girlfriends and ONS..again, nothing to do with my looks.  My bodycount is >70 and I've had model-looks male friends in the past who've gone home alone, but fist bumped me when I didn't \n\nI'm now settled with my LT girlfriend (8 years). She's a absolute knock-out 5'6\" leggy blonde who is taller than me in heels (which she wears out a lot) I give her commitment, safety, security and I keep her grounded We go and have fun regularly and travel and she loves me to bits.\n\nI summary.  It's not about height or looks.  It's about you, your self-esteem and your personality that will win through if you go to work on those.  Read books on it, Google it, watch YouTube videos.\n\nBest of luck."

                "body": "When you say whenever you start feeling okay something goes wrong, I think that negative mindset isn‚Äôt going to be very helpful in the long run. If you‚Äôve experienced some horrible things then by no means am I trying to say ignore it but even when facing lots of bad things, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge what is and is not within your control and acknowledge that everything isn‚Äôt exclusively ‚Äòbad‚Äô or ‚Äògood‚Äô. If something is outside of your control, there is no point in feeling bad about it and you should instead look for what you are able to control, because feeling bad is just a messenger saying something needs to change. \n\nAnd optimism goes a hell of a long way. For example, if you don‚Äôt get that job you really wanted that sucks but what if it opened up opportunities for another job you would‚Äôve loved more anyway or leads you to a situation where you find a new friend - even something very bad in the current may turn out to be good in the future. The silver lining is what makes life enjoyable and even if it feels silly and a lie, surely it‚Äôs better than believing the world and everything in it is shit.\n\nWhen you say you‚Äôve accomplished basically nothing I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true and it isn‚Äôt a very healthy view of yourself. Get rid of all those expectations and comparing yourself to other people. You‚Äôve lived 20 years and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve done a ton in that time. If you want to, try and spent a solid 5 or 10 minutes writing down every accomplishment you can think of. How about making friends, making people smile, skills you‚Äôve learnt like writing or communicating or cooking, hobbies you‚Äôve done, information you‚Äôve learnt. You‚Äôve done a lot and diminishing that because it isn‚Äôt ‚Äôgood enough‚Äô is diminishing yourself.\n\nGoing about your life, see if you can figure out what makes you happy and what you find meaningful regardless of others‚Äô opinions. Do you like when you help others, do you like completing things, do you like pushing yourself, do you like others to value and love you? You‚Äôve got a whole personality in there, you just need to try and start listening. \n\nHopefully something in here is helpful, and don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre young and even when everyone around you seems to have their life together THEY DON‚ÄôT. Even the best people still have insecurities and fears because that is part of being a person, it‚Äôs just about trying to make sure those negative feelings don‚Äôt completely take over"

        "text": "I'll start by saying this post isn't going where you may think it's going.\n\nTLDR: My whole body has fallen apart and dysfunctioned most of my life, out of my control. It got very severe for 9 years. It took me that long to learn how others would be able to help me heal, but in the meantime I took responsibility for teaching and doing everything myself to get better, but I almost died in the process. Don't think you have to do everything alone; help from others can heal you faster than doing it all yourself.\n\nI've spent the last 9 years living with every muscle and nerve in my body dysfunctioning, firing off nasty spasms, pinching nerves, and creating nerve damage almost everywhere imaginable in my body: Eyes, organs, face, feet, everything in between\n\nEveryday challenges had become massive inconveniences, and my energy and vitality has gone downhill because of fatiguing muscle. I have no social life, and my mind is callused with perceiving most things as very energy consuming. I lived in a constant state of heightened stress, panic attacks, anxiety, fear, shame, and guilt (while having ADHD) until only the past year. I had no appetite, my organs were losing functionality including my brain having restricted resources, and I had widespread nerve pain and weakness in every part of my body. I was pretty much falling apart before I was even 30, and I still don't know exactly why.\n\nIt has felt incredibly debilitating and devastating to constantly be faced with real, tangible weakness and fragility at such a young age, when I've wanted nothing but to be strong and healthy. No one has pinpointed the exact reason, and no matter what I did, I kept getting worse. I lost jobs, relationships, and friends to bring crippled by whatever this is.\n\n To wake up from living in denial of how damaged the functioning my body has been, and undertaking the task of living and dealing with it has been a nightmare. I've had to develop a lot of compassion for myself and reminding myself I am always doing the best I can.\n\nI've lost a majority of my 20s to this, it started at 19. I'm now 28, in physical therapy, getting help from doctors, taking medication, and regular ER visits have stopped (I went 5 times in the last 3 months, 2 of those times in an ambulance).\n\nI can wear backpacks again, sort of. I'm not waking up with my skull compressing my airway anymore at 2 am from muscle weakness and spasms. I can wear sweaters again without my shoulders dislocating. I can brush my hair without irritating nerves in my neck that cause paralysis to shoot down to the rest of my body. \n\nI'm no longer bleeding internally and randomly passing out. I can walk with both of my hips in place. My weight isn't 15 lbs underweight. My eyes, hands, neck, legs, and supportive back muscles are starting to work better. My height is increasing from having correct posture. I'm back to work without my jaw dislocating talking to customers.\n\nI still can't wear the clothes I want, I still come home from work fatigued and too exhausted to get my actions together to make food. I still struggle to do every day tasks.....\n\n but I'm no longer wondering every day if I'm going to die or not. I'm no longer feeling hopeless and helpless that I'm destined to live a life of pain and suffering.\n\nThings are looking up, and it's because of the hard work and belief I've had in myself, and allowing myself the blessing of receiving help. I had to get to a point where I could accept help before I could get better.\n\nNobody is capable of being good at everything, and that's why we have each other. I waited too long to get help because I thought I could do everything.\n\nTo anyone feeling like they're going through thick shit in life alone, please don't wait anymore to ask for help with your problems. You don't have to solve everything yourself, other people can accept the responsibility of taking the things that weigh on you off of your plate, especially if they've committed years of their lives to one thing; if that one thing is what you're suffering from, let them in. I learned experts are more educated than I ever could be from Google.\n\nI'm actually beginning to see a light at the end of this tunnel of pain and agony.\n\nI can't wait for this to be over.",

        "title": "Losing A Half Of Me - Day 203",
        "text": "Today was absolutely spectacular. I was hella busy and loved every second of it. I woke up and got myself composed. After that I headed out for some errands. I went off to check some stores for things that are going on and quickly hit the mall to get myself a small gift. Everytime I'm in the area I get a DnD collectible minifigure at the Lego store, especially since the ones at my store are labeled to which one is which. I really want all of them for use in DnD and MOC builds. They are cheap and it is a very small yay me for getting some work. Sometimes you have to spend a bit on yourself to show yourself you are worth it. After that I went to the doctor's office for dermatology. I further learned my liver enzymes are doing much better and dropped by about half then what they were before so my panel doesn't look like that of a cirrhosis patient. I hope that will help with the way I feel over time and will also improve my immense hair shedding. If it doesn't though, then it will soon have to be something I need to accept and mentally figure out. It hurts but I can do it. I then headed to work. It felt very different with my new boss. I did a lot of the same stuff but less at the same time. Two things I was not the biggest fan of was that the one person I used to work with is unbelievably rude to customers now. Before I made sure the other boss tried to keep her in check by telling her about it. Now the new boss probably just allows it. I had a family member tell me they miss me at the shop since the people there are not as nice. I thought she was being nice to me and trying to make me feel good but that does not feel like the case. I don't appreciate that kind of attitude towards customers but it's not my place. Also one of the first things the new boss told me was to put my phone in the back. No problem for me since I don't use it unless to make an emergency call or ask family if anything is needed or some questions to be answered by staff/customers. The two people at the store were using it left and right. She was on her phone half the time at work in the past and I thought this would be a great rule. I guess it just applies to me, the one person who almost never used it unless for an emergency or to research stuff for customers or talks with my employers. It seems weird that this rule was said to me but it didn't really prove a problem towards me. This boss also seems less focused on cleanup so I felt like I overdid everything I worked on. Either way it was a good day. I snacked on a couple of things at the job just to try them again. They were a bit carb heavy so the next work day I must avoid them. I will be strong and I got this. I missed those pierogies and one of these nights I'll have them as my cheat night. Right now though I'll avoid them and be happy I had a little treat today (Note: Make a baked potato soon for dinner). I went to the gym after and my cousin texted me to meet her there but something came up. I did my leg day by myself. Here was my routine:\n\nSeated leg press:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 50 55 and 60 pounds\n\nNote: Did 30 35 40 at the end of each set only doing one leg 3 times each but 2 at 40\n\nLeg extension:\nReps of 8 6 6 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 65 70 and 75 pounds\n\nSeated leg curl:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 55 60 and 65 pounds\n\nHip adduction:\nReps of 8 6 4 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 85 90 and 95\n\n15 minutes of the stair stepper. I upped how fast it went after 10 minutes from 44 steps per minute to 60.\n\nAfter I got home, I passed out for a bit. I woke up and wasn't sure what to eat. My sister left lunch meat and other ingredients. Maybe she did it to help me or maybe she did it because she is forgetful. Either way she won't be able to use it before it expires so I want to eat it for the fact that I am still trying to save. Make whatever food is in the fridge last as long as possible when I can. I made a great sandwich with a lot of meat. I'm happy she got turkey since it is much better calorie and protein wise than other deli meats. I also didn't think about it until after but mustard or horseradish would have been such a better alternative to the sandwich. While mayo tastes great, the small quantity in the sandwich had no influence at all and has way too many calories. I won't be making that mistake again in the near future or hopefully far future. All of this combined was my day and honestly I loved it. Here is what was put in my belly:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\n1 slice of toast - 100 calories (3 g protein)\n\n24 g of peanut butter - ~145 calories (~5.3 g protein)\n\nLunch:\n\n173 g of apple - ~110 calories (.26 g protein)\n\n182 g of tomato - ~55 calories (~1.5 g protein)\n\n110 g of macaroni and cheese - ~240 calories (~11.3 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n2 pierogies - ~130 calories (4 g protein)\n\n1 Banana - 105 calories (1.3 g protein)\n\nPasta salad mixed with antipasto - ~100 calories (~2 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n2 slices of bread - 160 calories (6 g protein)\n\n13 g of mayo - 90 calories\n\n65 g of cheese - ~255 calories (~16.3 g protein)\n\n141 g of deli turkey breast - ~175 calories (~32.7 g protein)\n\nSBIST was being able to work. It wasn't much money and it wasn't much time but it's something. It is something to put in my pocket towards groceries, meds, and car bills. At the same time, it's nice to be moving and doing something. I am a hard worker and I like just being able to do what I can. It's nice being able to have more time to do what I want during the day but I feel like it has me not wanting to do anything or just smaller amounts of it. I also think having a lower wage job will kick me onto even higher gear to find what I need for my plan. A plan for my future. \n\nTomorrow will be me doing what I can around the house and figuring out other stuff. I'll have work on the day after that and watching my grandparent's dog further after that which will also be my cheat day. I also have a weigh in tomorrow and what I am hoping for is a constant weight or even a pound or two of gain is fine by me with the cheat day and the holiday. It's okay to have weeks like this and I am happy about it. I just have to stay consistent the weeks after and I know I will see results. If not, then I change it up. Thank you my conjurers of the slack. You let me understand that some weeks are about staying constant and learning from there. \n\n",

Maybe both for that same reason?\n\nMoney is not gonna make you happy and neither will \"having a nice job\". If you don't care about your job, then it doesn't matter how much money you make or how well regarded it is in society. If you try to live your life based on the expectations of others, then you're not likely to ever be truly happy with it. Because most people who think this same way have also just adopted those ideas about what it takes to have a \"good life\" from others. So it's become a self perpetuating cycle where everyone just does what they're told, expecting to be happy. And for some it works because just being part of the herd is what they care about more than anything else. While others feel like something is lacking. A purpose or meaning behind it all.\n\nTo make it short: If you want to bring some meaning into your life, then you need to look for it. Money won't make you happy, as already stated, and neither will fame or recognition. Maybe if you're a deeply insecure person who craves approval and feels the need to prove to everyone that they are someone. But those people will always remain in secure, so don't go down that path.\n\nInstead look for things that you can enjoy. If you don't care about your job, then either find a way to make money that you'd enjoy more. Or just find a way to reduce the amount of time you have to spend on making money as much as possible, so you're free to focus on the things that actually matter to you. And that might even be some voluntary work, something that you don't get paid for. Yet it might be a lot more enjoyable to you than any job you could possibly have, so you'll gladly do it for free or even pay for it yourself.\n\nSo focus on what is worth doing to you and what you can enjoy. That's what will make you happy. The other stuff, making money to survive, is what you need to do. So there's no point in spending more time on it than necessary. It should certainly not take over your life."

(put realistic plans so that you don‚Äôt get disappointed when you don‚Äôt complete them all). \nand so on‚Ä¶ \n\nsecond, don‚Äôt compare yourself to your friends or anybody. i relate to that feeling although i‚Äôve worked through it. my best friend and i studied psychology together. i‚Äôm very interested in the topic so missing classes made me feel like i‚Äôm missing out on information but she would skip her classes without a care in the world. i would study days and nights because i never settled for a grade below A-. She never cared. all she cared about was just getting an average grade. (i love my best friend and i‚Äôm not speaking negatively about her - just a difference in personalities). however, she is now a therapist and i am a preschool teacher. things came easy to her and not to me and for a long time i struggled with that until i learnt that everyone‚Äôs life is different. life has different plans for me and i‚Äôm eager to know what they are. i know i‚Äôll be a therapist one day but in my own time. i am happy for my best friend and wholeheartedly hope to see her in higher places. \nyou will get to where you want to go in your own time. time management and planning is the key. \n\ncoming to your partner, the thought you had of someone else taking her from you is your insecure self reflecting upon your relationship. you are feeling insecure about your career life which in my opinion is overshadowing your personal feelings in your relationship. be aware of where your feelings come from so you can navigate through them. and maybe talk to her about them when you feel like you‚Äôre struggling too much with these thoughts. \n\nyou got this. believe in yourself. give yourself some love, time, trust, and rest. get into planning. organize your thoughts. you are not alone."

I built a website from scratch using WordPress... Then I didn't travel for the las 2 years, so nothing to add or be relevant about.\n2. I wanted to showcase some of my photography. However, I just feel like my photos don't stand out enough to be worth showing when I compare myself to more professional people who are out there all days when I just don't have inspiration where I live...\n3. I want to work in digital marketing/community management, but I don't have experience, and nobody hire me.\n\nSo I'm just doing trial and errors, not finding my calling, just feeling worthless. All that to have a job I would love to do. For some people, a job is just what give you money and that's it. But for me, it's more than that. I have no life outside of work and for me work is where I get all my socialization, my friends, etc.\n\nHow do I break this cycle of self-doubt? How do I find something I‚Äôm good at and build confidence in it? I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I don‚Äôt have anything to offer or like I‚Äôll never be seen.\n\nI also hate to see all those fake ads of people who tell you that it takes 2 seconds to get experiences, clients and a beautiful life.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice or guidance from people who‚Äôve been through this.",

It's a huge problem... I can get either no sleep at all, maybe 1-4 hours, or have days I'll sleep 12 for the fact I need it. Any ideas on what to do I desperately need some help and advice.

You said that you feel overwhelmed; probably you have your reasons, but it could be deeper than you believe. \n\nFirst of all: take melatonin. Not a medical advice, of course, but when I started taking it (2mg per night, 30 minutes before sleeping), with no noises in my room, creating my own routine, my sleep improved a lot. Find some activity that can relax you after you take melatonin. It could be reading. Personally I play chess or solve chess problems. It just has to let your brain know that you're going to sleep.\n\nMelatonin will solve your issue superficially, so you'll sleep because you basically can't control nature. \n\nSecond point: make blood analysis, the most complete you can, to check if you're lacking supplements of any kind. If yes, integrate. Also, analyze your diet: are you eating enough calories? Are you intolerant to something? \n\nTo be honest, the most common scenario, is that you don't sleep for psychological reasons, so consider having therapy. Analyze what bothers you the most, and solve the issue. Sometimes stuff are pretty deep, but once you figure out the reason, you can work on it."

People tell me to take melatonin helps, it doesn't for me, but most people I talk to it works. Nyquil is great, but it can be addicting. I took Nyquil a couple nights just so I could fall alseep, but I ended up waking up at 2 and couldn't fall alseep until 3. I am sleeping better now, though. Honestly, for me to just realize that the things I'm stressing out on are out of my control I feel better.  I was really stressed because of a guy I was talking to, and I have never been more exhausted in my life, and I was waking up early for hunting, earlier than I'm used to. Mental stress is honestly worse than physical stress, at least in my case. You are not alone in this. \n\nMy advice would be to maybe make a list of the goals you have in life, whether it be gym goals, career goals, or even small tasks. Focus on your priorities, or what you want the most. And when it comes to not being able to shut your brain off at night, I have the same problem like I mentioned earlier...but for me, I just think if it's out of my control, or thinking about it won't help the problem, don't think about it. And it'd really hard, especially because I am a HUGE overthinker. Eating healthier helps as well. I notice my physical and mental health are better the healthier I eat. Hope this helps, and never give up! :)"

When you've been so intensely focused on something for so long, finally reaching it sort of leaves you thinking \"well what now?\" That's where hyper-fixation sort of reveals its rather major flaws. The reality is, when you pour all your energy, into **one** goal, it often comes at the expense of other important areas of life that also deserve attention. And then ultimately you're virtually just left with a void, and you find yourself searching for ways to fill it, but don't necessarily have the means to do so because you've invested all your time in one thing. I think it's always important to have something to look forward to, but I think it's equally as important to be able to ground yourself in other areas of life too."

I'm also highly sensitive to criticism (in therapy right now and working on it). My boyfriend and I have a loving but at times pretty argumentative relationship.\n\nWe're stuck in this loop where he'll voice a concern he has about my behavior, we'll argue/talk it through, we'll come to a conclusion, and then I still feel angry/upset about it afterwards. Sometimes I've skipped work the next day because I was worried I was going to start crying about it in the office. My boyfriend found out I was doing that and was obviously upset and asked me not to lie about it when that happens.\n\nThe problem is that now we're stuck because he's increasingly afraid to voice any concerns or frustrations he has because he's afraid he'll trigger a breakdown. I've reassured him over and over again that my reactions aren't his responsibility and that my choices are mine and it isn't his job to censor himself to keep me calm but obviously this is small comfort to him. \n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\nHe came over to my apartment and I cooked dinner.

At the end of the night, he said he was going to take the dog out, and I said, \"Can you do the dishes while I take the dog out?\" \n\nWhen I got back, we had the following conversation:\n\n**Him:** \"Hey, I'm a little frustrated that you took the dog out and left me to do all of your old dishes from earlier this week.\" \n\n**Me (confused):** \"You didn't have to do all that, I just wanted you to do the dishes from tonight.\" \n\n**Him (frustrated):** \"Well, I couldn't just do those dishes, because your sink was full. I had nowhere to wash the pots.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Oh, I didn't realize that. You should have just done some of the dishes, whatever you thought was appropriate. You didn't have to do all of them, that's not your responsibility, they're my dishes.\" \n\n**Him:** \"That's silly, if I say I'm going to do the dishes I'm just going to do all of them. I would feel lazy if I stopped before the job was done. It's fine, it's not a big deal. Why don't you just do your dishes more often?\"\n\n**Me (upset):** \"I agree with you but since it's my apartment, I didn't realize that me not doing the dishes was going to affect you. I wish you'd just done your portion, I would have been completely fine if you'd left the rest of them for me to do later.\"\n\nThis continues in circles for at least an hour. We finally reach a half-truce and go to bed. When we wake up in the morning I still feel upset and angry and ashamed. We rehash the argument again in the morning and come to what feels like a semi-optimistic conclusion. \n\nHowever, once he leaves, I still feel upset thinking about it. I'm afraid to go into work because in the past, I've ended up ruminating on our arguments the entire day and getting more and more upset about them all over again. Sometimes I've cried at work because I feel so overwhelmed and frustrated. \n\nSo I call in and skip work. Then I tell my boyfriend that I'm skipping work (\"Did not go into work today, gonna bring it up at my therapist appointment this week. How's your day going? :)\") trying to keep it lighthearted. He calls me immediately and is upset with himself for saying anything while I'm basically in tears again trying to reassure him that he was right to express his frustrations and it's not his job to manage my emotions for me. \n\nThis kind of thing happens a lot. Is this something we have to talk about with a couples' therapist, or do I need to see a specialized therapist? Right now I've been seeing a therapist who specializes in DBT but does not have specific experience with ADHD. We're both exhausted and burnt out. I feel micromanaged and overly sensitive. He feels disrespected and helpless. ",

                "body": "Oh my lord, you shouldn't have to take off work because your boyfriend griped about doing the dishes. I know you know that, and I feel for you. Getting stuck in unproductive patterns is so frustrating, and especially complicated when the patterns are the creation of two people. I'm glad you're asking for advice. Couples therapy is a good idea.\n\nIMHO? You both need to take responsibility for your actions and turn towards each other during conflict. \n\nHe could have said \"there's a lot of dishes, will you help me when you get back? Or why don't we do them together and then take the dog out together?\" and prevented it from being a thing at all.\n\nYou also could have said in your initial response \"oh I'm sorry, I'll set a reminder for myself to do the dishes before you come over next time so there aren't so many to do.\"  ~The End~\n\nYou also seem to have some shame around not doing the dishes often enough, because you got defensive and dodged the question when he asked you why you don't do them more often (kind of a stupid question to ask your ADHD gf tho, like no shit, basic tasks are hard, that's like the main thing about ADHD).\n\nIf you feel like it's not possible to think straight in the moment because you're having strong emotions (are you on meds? emotions are so much harder to process without meds), then stop! Continue the conversation a day or a week later when you've been able to gather your thoughts. Just say \"I'm having a strong emotional reaction to what you're saying right now, it's making it hard to think, let's put a pin in this for later.\" Or if it's a pretty mundane issue, just get real formal about it (tongue in cheek tho) \"Hmmm ok thanks for your feedback, I'll take that under consideration. Do you mind if we circle back at the end of the week?\" \n\nDiscuss this strategy with him ahead of time - he has to agree he will stop pushing the issue and compartmentalize his feelings too. And he'll probably benefit from taking some time to reflect and decide whether he's just nitpicking your behaviour and should let it go or whether you really are doing something he finds disrespectful/hurtful. \n\nAlso, sometimes bizarre spiral arguments happen! You're tired, you're preoccupied, you're stressed, you're hangry, whatever. Try not to assign too much meaning to it or take it too personally. Communication is a skill you have to learn and practice. But it only works if both of you put in the work. Hence couples therapy.\n\nETA: Some of your language like \"burdening\" and \"emotional whiplash\" speaks volumes about the shame & blame you feel (I'm assuming those are your words and not his). This isn't entirely a \"you\" issue, I hope you know that. These unhealthy patterns are co-created and it's not all your fault. I've given you both the benefit of the doubt here but it's quite possible that you are just not compatible. There's plenty of guys out there who don't bitch about doing the dishes honey."

Following morning at 8 or 9 o'clock you resume. It's an extreme approach but it comes down to surviving minute by minute.\n\nMy other idea is a conceptually simple self development formula. If you want to make progress, but not worry about the detail, you can do this every day. There is effort involved, but it's only 20 minutes. Also it's a highly efficient form of work and you don't easily lose the gains you've made. It's an investment in yourself, and goes where you go.

I snack on junk all day, skip meals, and am on the verge of being underweight .I am ugly, balding, unhealthy and my face is full with acne marks.\n\n\n\nNot good at academics either. i got a 6.7 cgpa (max 10) till midsem and my finals are 10days to go. And i study at an average of 1hr each day. My screentime is an avg of 10hrs daily with it peaking to 14hours sometimes. My brain feels rotten.  \n\n\n\nI had an exam today; it was my last chance to save my grades, so i studied hard for it, just to misread pyramid as a prisms and realize only 3 mins before the exam ended. I got 3/20, and got called to the teachers office. Im tired of my stupidity, carelessness, and spineless confidence-less nature. \n\n  \nWherever i go, i see confident productive and beautiful people, and i am neither.  my batchmates are being part of hackathons, coding clubs, stock market clubs, science conferences, and still getting straight A despite playing football and doing gym all day. \n\n\n\nThe first semester of my freshman yr in college is about to end in 3 weeks, and i did absolutely nothing. I can count the number of people I met in the past 4 months on my hands.  Plus i'll be turning 20 pretty soon. \\\\\n\n  \nPlus ive never been in a relationship, never! and everywhere I see people in some sort of relationships. I think its been 2 months since i talked to a girl. I feel so miserable. like a stupid slow ugly slug\n\n\n\nFking 20, and I have never earned a penny in my life. I have been like this for the past 5 years, hell probably even before but i don't remember. I have always been an underachiever, as long as i remember, in everything, while  younger sibling has qualified Mathematics Olympiad and will probably go to an Ivy\n\nI feel ashamed of going back home. I don't have an answer to what i did in my entire 1st sem, except scrolling youtube shorts. I feel like a burden, on everyone. \n\n  \nI tried to change, so many times, but its a joke at this point. every time a promise i will be better tommorow, i already know its the adrenaline speaking. \n\n  \nI do not know what to do; even if i did, im sure i won't do anything except scrolling reels all night till 7am in the morning. \n\n\n\nidk what do to. I just wanted to vent out somewhere. its making me really uncomfortable thinking i won't be a teenager in a couple of months",

Someone who's healthy is automatically scared of things as well. Fact is that reality is not linear.\n\nPsychologically speaking, I think that you are simply an extremely curious person, but at the same time afraid of death. So basically you do multiple stuff to satisfy your curiosities, and then, not to feel guilty, you are healthy. A sort of compensation. \n\nThis \"hedonistic\" approach has only one problem: when you wanna have fun at all costs, you could die young, so you'll have fun for a short period of time. Of course it's better to have a \"long-term\" fun, calculating risks. \n\nYou'll solve your issues when you'll figure out the clear different between FEAR and CONSCIOUSNESS. \n\nFear is something that blocks you, leading you to a boring and over-complicated life. Consciousness is knowing when doing something is too risky and childish. Is knowing when something is not worthy. \n\nAlso, if I were your therapist, I'd probably analyze your childhood. Did you grow in a too strict family? With too strict rules? Are you sure you're not trying to \"pass limits\" because you couldn't do so when you were a child? \n\nJust some hints you can think about."

I guess you've worked hard and deeply improved your life to raise your chances. \n\nA little tip that so you can think about: in life, USUALLY, and it'll happen to you multiple and multiple times (I'm a 26M so I'm 10 years older) you'll fail painfully, but then, after a while, you'll figure out that such failure was an OPPORTUNITY. \n\nYou'll fail your exams, relationships, and so on. But then, after a while, you'll figure out that failure usually is not failure, but an intermediate lesson. \n\nIn your case, you made several actions to try to win. You IMPROVED yourself. You EXPANDED your persona. \n\nTurn the anger into energy; start loving the fact that when you want something, you fight for it. When you lose, universe has better plans for you. \n\nAlso internalize the fact that, when you lack motivation, you're stuck. And there's no win in life if you stay in bed and don't fight."

I speak to my best friend going on 16 years maybe 3-4 times a year. I still can't remember the name of his youngest kid who was born 3 years ago. But whenever we do talk, we're laughing and cutting up just like we did in high school.\n\nBut what I've realized, in some cases far too late, is that not all men are like this. I know, \"duh\". There are men out there that if you don't make at least some attempt to maintain that connection, chat with them every couple months, maybe see them every few years, they take it as a sign that you don't value their friendship.\n\nSad thing is, most men would never admit this, certainly not to each other. It makes us sound too needy. \n\nSo how do y'all do it? Reminder on your phone, post-it on the calendar? Or, if you're like me, do you think, \"I'll miss this friendship but that level of contact just isn't who I am?\"",

        "text": "One of the most maddening things is knowing exactly what the right thing to do is‚Äîand still not being able to do it.¬†\n\nYou know you shouldn‚Äôt act needy. You know you should give them space. You know you‚Äôre pushing them away, but you can‚Äôt stop yourself. It‚Äôs like watching yourself from the outside, doing the exact opposite of what you know will help, and hating yourself for it.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just about dating.¬†\n\nIt could be freaking out at people, binge-watching trash on Netflix, eating crap, or falling back into various bad habits you keep promising to quit.¬†\n\nYou ‚Äúfail‚Äù.. and then you start beating yourself up.\n\n*What‚Äôs wrong with me? Why can‚Äôt I stop? Am I just weak? Didn‚Äôt Jocko say I need more discipline?*\n\nIf it was only as simple as trying harder!\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs not about discipline. It‚Äôs not about willpower. It‚Äôs not even about being weak. The real problem is that most of us completely misunderstand how human beings actually work.\n\nWe like to think we‚Äôre in charge of ourselves, that our logical brain‚Äîthe part saying, *Don‚Äôt do this*‚Äîis the one steering the ship. But that‚Äôs not how it works.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôve probably heard the analogy of the rider and the elephant.¬†\n\nThe rider is your logical mind, the ‚Äòhigher‚Äô, more evolved, part of you trying to steer in the ‚Äúright‚Äù direction. The elephant is your emotions‚Äîpowerful, primal, stubborn, and hard to communicate with.¬†\n\nAnd when the elephant wants to go somewhere, the rider is just along for the ride. You can try to pull it, but it is big, you are small, and you quickly tire of trying to exert direct control.\n\nThe thing we don‚Äôt realize is that you‚Äôre not just the rider. You‚Äôre also the elephant. \n\nIf anything, by weight and influence, ‚Äúyou‚Äù are far more elephant than rider. 95% elephant if we are being generous. Unfortunately, in the west, the majority of us think of ourselves as the rider on top of this unruly elephant, struggling to direct it, tame it, and get it to conform to our wishes.\n\nSo when someone starts pulling away from you in a relationship and you feel that overwhelming need to chase them, that‚Äôs the elephant taking over. It‚Äôs not a failure of discipline. It‚Äôs your emotional wiring telling that you‚Äôre in danger and trying to keep you safe.¬†\n\nIt feels like survival. And survival always wins.\n\nIf you‚Äôve got attachment issues‚Äîlet‚Äôs say anxious attachment‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbad behavior.‚Äù¬†\n\nThis is old, deeply rooted stuff. It goes back to childhood, when staying attached to a caregiver meant survival. That feeling of abandonment? It‚Äôs not just uncomfortable. It‚Äôs *terrifying*. It‚Äôs primal. And no amount of ‚Äújust stop being needy, bro‚Äù is going to override that fear. It‚Äôs like telling someone not to flinch while you‚Äôre smashing their hand with a hammer. Sure, they might hold out for one hit, but by the second or third? The reflex takes over. The elephant takes over.\n\nThe mistake most people make is thinking they can just fight this.¬†\n\nThey try to control their emotions, suppress their impulses, or shove everything down until it explodes. But suppressing your emotions doesn‚Äôt fix anything‚Äîit just delays the inevitable. And when it finally does come out, it‚Äôs worse. \n\nThat‚Äôs why the guy who‚Äôs constantly calm and in control ends up ‚Äúgoing postal‚Äù one day, while the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù guy who vents all the time is not likely to explode.¬†\n\nSuppression doesn‚Äôt solve the problem; it just makes you tired, stressed, miserable, and disconnected from yourself.\n\nSo what‚Äôs the answer?¬†\n\nThe first step is to stop fighting yourself.¬†\n\nStop saying: *This isn‚Äôt me. I shouldn‚Äôt be like this.*¬†\n\nIt is you.¬†\n\nThe neediness, the anger, the impulses you can‚Äôt control‚Äîthat‚Äôs all you.¬†\n\nAnd the harder you fight it, the less energy you have to actually change it. Accepting it doesn‚Äôt mean indulging it or saying it‚Äôs fine. It means acknowledging that this is how you are right now, without trying to shame or suppress it.\n\nOnce you stop fighting yourself, you can start to figure out what‚Äôs actually driving these behaviors. What‚Äôs causing the fear? What‚Äôs triggering the neediness?¬†\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the uncomfortable part: the answers are almost always in the past. Your childhood, your early relationships, your old wounds. It sucks to go there, but ignoring it just keeps you stuck.\n\nWhen you start addressing the root cause, the behavior begins to change on its own. You don‚Äôt have to force yourself to stop being needy‚Äîyou will, slowly and over time, just stop being needy.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs like being hungry. You don‚Äôt willpower your way through hunger; you eat something, and the hunger goes away.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs the same with your emotions. You address the wound, and the compulsions start to fade.\n\nMost people never get to this point because they spend their energy fighting the symptoms instead of fixing the cause. They are too proud to admit that they can‚Äôt ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô themselves, and are too ashamed to look beneath the surface. They keep themselves stuck in this miserable cycle of shame, control, and failure.¬†\n\nBut when you start working with yourself instead of against yourself, everything changes. It‚Äôs not easy, and it‚Äôs not fast, but it‚Äôs the only thing that works.\n\n",

        "text": "Today was a very good relaxing and bear hibernation kind of day. My back and shoulders and forearms were killing me. This shows me one thing and it is that I need to start working those muscle groups more. I need to do it for my sake. I also am trying to get rid of the remainder of the Turkey Day feast from the fridge. We only took home what we made per whoever house it was but that meant mac and cheese was going back to our house. I love the stuff and will eat it in moderation. I didn't realize how dense it was when weighing it in the scale and also made sure to drain it after hearing it in the microwave. I don't want all that liquid fat remaining on the plate to go into my system. I have also been making an effort to have some carbs in my daily food intake but not to have too many. Tomorrow I'll have one slice of bread but put more peanut butter on it. That will be less calories and less carbs while still having something filling and worth it. A lot of my day consisted of deleting tabs when I could and relaxing to the best of my ability. I wanted to go to the gym but the workout yesterday with my cousins took away that desire from how sore I was in unexpected places. Instead I leave behind a day that didn't get much accomplished but did leave it for the following day to get so much accomplished. Tomorrow will be a day with much more fruit to be taken advantage of and I can't wait. Here is what I ate today:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\n2 slices of toast - 200 calories (6 g protein)\n\n32 g of peanut butter - 190 calories (7 g protein)\n\n2 g of honey - 6 calories\n\nLunch:\n\n151 g of pineapple - ~90 calories (~.7 g protein)\n\n148 g of mac and cheese - 325 calories (~15.2 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n43 g of cheese - ~170 calories (~10.8 g protein)\n\n300 g of tomato - ~95 calories (~2.5 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n200 g of ground chicken - ~300 calories (~61 g protein)\n\n4 taco shells - 260 calories (4 g protein)\n\n56 g of cheese - 180 calories (14 g protein)\n\n92 g of kidney beans - ~85 calories (~5 g protein) \n\nSBIST was the nice feeling of just being cozy. After the coma inducing food that was served yesterday it was nice to have this. I love a lot of the Turkey Day food that is made (if it's made well), but man it is dense. It likes to sit with you for way too long and weigh you down. Laying in bed and letting those calories burn off felt nice and my arms were still rough from the previous day. It was nice to let the hibernation kick in for a day after the food that was consumed. I felt like a bear and there's just something beautiful in that.\n\nTomorrow I have a much more packed day. I am waking up to go run some errands in the morning, have a doctor's appointment, and then have a few hours of work. It isn't much but money is money for me. I got to save up for some new tires for the wintertime roads. After that I am going to the gym for a leg day and maybe my cousin will contact me for us to work out together which would be quite lovely. Either way tomorrow has some things getting done and I'm happy about that. Thank you my conjurers of the lists. You give me things to check off on the busier days and I love that for me. \n",

        "title": "(Update) (Bad News) M21 Diagnosed with Multiple Conditions: A Journey of Struggle and Hope. ",
        "text": "\n\nHi everyone,\n\nA few days ago, I shared here about feeling depressed and going through a lot in my life. Today, after researching my symptoms and experiences, I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve been diagnosed with several psychological conditions that explain my struggles over the years:\n\n1. Satyriasis (Male Hypersexuality): This is the male counterpart to nymphomania in women. It involves intense and uncontrollable sexual urges, often interfering with daily life.\n\n2. ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder):\nI struggle with procrastination, lack of focus, and an inability to stick to schedules. My mind constantly feels like it‚Äôs racing, which makes concentrating on studies or work nearly impossible.\n\n3. PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder):\nI‚Äôve faced physical bullying, rejection, and traumatic experiences that still haunt me. The video taken of me being harassed, the threats I received after confessing feelings to someone, and family conflicts often replay in my mind, causing emotional distress.\n\n\n4. Depression:\nI feel sadness, loneliness, and hopelessness most of the time. The weight of being misunderstood, lacking friends, and struggling with family trauma has been overwhelming.\n\n\n5. Social Anxiety Disorder:\nI feel extremely shy and introverted in social situations. The idea of talking to new people, especially women, makes me anxious. I avoid social gatherings and often retreat into music to cope.\n\n\n6. Avoidant Personality Traits:\nI crave meaningful relationships but fear rejection and judgment. This fear makes me avoid getting too close to people, even though I deeply wish for companionship and understanding.\n\nI‚Äôve been living with these issues since I was 16, and they‚Äôve severely impacted my life. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been through:\n\nBullying: I was physically bullied at college and work. In one instance, a video of me being harassed was shared, and it still haunts me.\n\nRejection: I tried forming romantic connections, but my efforts led to rejection and even threats. A girl once spread rumors about me, turning others against me.\n\nFamily Trauma: I‚Äôve grown up in a difficult household where I feel misunderstood. My younger sister is rude, and my parents often side with her. It‚Äôs made me feel unloved and unsupported.\n\nLoneliness and Sadness: I‚Äôve been introverted, walking alone with music as my only companion. Despite my love for music and creativity, I often feel isolated.\n\nDespite all this, I‚Äôve always believed in helping others. If any male or female is in danger or needs help, I would gladly give my all to support them. I‚Äôm not a creep or pervert; I just feel that every male needs a female as emotional support, just as every female needs a male.\n\nI‚Äôm reaching out here because I hope for understanding and meaningful connections. If any girl is willing to be a friend or even consider a casual or deeper relationship without judgment, I‚Äôd be grateful. I‚Äôm 21 years old and have been dealing with these challenges for five years.\n\nThank you to everyone who reads this. I hope to heal, grow, and eventually lead a better life with genuine love and support.\n\nLet‚Äôs hope for brighter days ahead for me And Even Astrologicaly I am in ketu-shani dasha it will end on 29th November but one more year is left of ketu dasha then ketu budh will start and will end at 26 November 2025 much more struggle waiting my life is fully misunderstood like my personality.......\n\n",

Tell everyone the truth: that that was your wakeup call, you're embarrassed and ashamed of your behavior, and you're going to stop drinking so that it doesn't happen again. It instantly reframes the incident into something people will begin to respect you for. There is SO MUCH power in acknowledging your mistakes and truly apologizing. \n\nApologize to your sister- in- law, your family, your brother, and even your nephew if appropriate. Don't minimize, make it all about yourself, or make excuses. This sounds like, \"I am sorry for being inappropriate towards you during the party and embarrassing you in front of your son, friends, and family. I'm sorry that my actions made you choose between keeping the peace and your own dignity. I feel deeply ashamed, as this is not the person that I want to be, and I am going to stop drinking so that it doesn't happen again. I will work on my issues so that I don't ruin any more family events, and I am so sorry that my behavior disrupted this one. Thank you for your loyalty and patience, and I hope that you can forgive me.\"\n\nYou will be shocked how much shame you let go of immediately. Then, every day that you do better, you will start to feel pride, and that is a much better thing to live with."

        "text": "I could land my dream job tomorrow - one I had been aspiring  toward all my life - and I can guarantee that even if it was everything I had hoped for,  which it wouldn't be, soon enough it would start to lose it's luster and eventually I would find myself dreaming about greener pastures, and leaving it. \n\nI could finally date the unattainable girl who had been the apple of my eye for years and I have no doubt that within a month or two of seeing her I would begin to think 'sure she's amazing... but I wonder if I can't find someone who's even more amazing?' \n\nIn fact I have been in the latter situation with a girl who I had met a few times in person and failed to match with on dating apps for a year or so, she was one of the sexiest ladies I had seen who was in a band and seemed like the perfect person for me - I was devastated when I would send her a message and never match and even dreamt about her. One day we matched, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning, we had a date and she was amazing although she could never compete with the flawless ideal I had created in my head and nor should she have to. By about the 5th date I was already backs swiping on dating apps, wondering if someone even better was out there and no longer getting very excited whenever I would see her name appear on my phone. \n\nI have diagnosed ADHD and I think this is partly to blame for my novelty seeking and also extreme boredom which can set in once novelty begins to subside. \n\nI  try not to let this bullshit derail my journey but it inevitably does. \n\nThen I get wracked with self loathing and regret when I think back over the job opportunities and more painfully the potential relationship I have let slide through my fingers because I didn't hold onto them tight enough. Even a few friendships fell to the wayside because I didn't appreciate them enough. \n\nFor the longest time I didn't realize how badly I was sabotaging myself by doing this, and I am a master at rationalizing my oftentimes foolish impulsive decisions, but now I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions as I sit single in a dead end job. \n\nI know I can't change the past and all I can do is learn not to make the same mistakes, but it's much easier said than done. It's like my brain is hard wired to seek novelty at all costs and to idealize people and things, and while I've discussed this with my psychologist, I haven't really gotten any better at managing it. Awareness is the first step to improving but trying to brute force myself to stick with something once the novelty wears off and trying to remind myself to appreciate what I've got only gets me so far. It's almost like trying to convince myself that I'm happy right now - it's not entirely futile but it doesn't really hold much weight unless I actually feel that way subconsciously. \n\nYeah I know intellectually that I will almost certainly regret pulling the plug on a relationship or a job, and I know the grass is rarely greener indeed it is greener where you water it but that's not how I feel in the moment, and eventually those feelings convince me to search for something better or in any case shinier. \n\nBut if I don't find a way to overcome this then a lonely road of misery and self hatred lies ahead. \n\nI don't really want to even attempt another relationship and risk hurting someone until I'm confident that I have brought this under control but I guess I can't really say for certain that I have until I'm in that situation again. \n\nOn a different but related note my grandparents don't have much time left, and I want to appreciate what time remains with them without thinking 'fuck I have to appreciate them before they're gone!' because again that's obviously counterproductive. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I would love to hear it ",

Sometimes it's best to leave good friendships that died off where they belong, in the past, and move on to build new ones. They will still be good memories to you."

Cyber cafes. Hobby shops. Even if you're a console gamer, go into a tabletop gaming store and the staff most likely would know when and where the types of previously mentioned video gamer spots and events are.\n\nPeople that are going to tournaments or playing at locals are gamers like you, into the same thing you are. And are trying to get better, improve, and be social. They are open to helping someone, they are open to training hours trying new things. And simply when you're out in the world doing a fun activity with people you simply say something to the effect of, \"Hey guys this was fun wanna do this again some time?\" And then exchange contact information. \n\nThen you build rapport. So like yes at first your friendship is just based on gaming. But maybe while gaming or after you go to get food and talk, and you develop more understanding of what other things you two share in common and things you could do together. \n\nI suspect that what's happening with your other friends is that you are linked by only one activity, gaming, which isn't bad to have only one link with someone if you have a large group of diverse friends but it does make it hard when that is the only person you have.

I am able to recognize these, but some of them (incorrectly) feel helpful, and if I drop one thread of thought, another one pops right up RIGHT AWAY. It‚Äôs as if my brain processes my experiences in this way and preps to share with a theoretical person. Ultimately, even if they are not stressful thoughts/convos, they take up a lot of focus and energy. I‚Äôd say 90% of my free roam thoughts during the day are of this type and most are not stressful at all, just my brain processing and expressing boring experiences and ideas in this specific way. Definitely have some anxiety, dx with ADHD (mild), and suspected CPTSD ‚Äî noting severe although anxiety and adhd medication has not helped. Any tips?",

A convo can loop in my head on and off for days, and then when I finally say it out loud to myself I often immediately understand what the central problem is, or I can hear that there is no problem and I can let it go.\n\n\nLong term, mindfulness/practicing being present with what's actually happening instead of in your head all the time will be helpful, too."

We are in the middle of an expansion and will be scaling the business to 500% the size. With this will come new employees, and I don't plan to hire somebody I am that personally close with ever again, so most employees I will have in the future will be complete randos or maybe acquaintances. Me and my girlfriend fight occasionally, she's a very stubborn girl, more often than not it is relationship bickering or fueled by something I did (or didn't do) that day. Sometimes our fights are strictly about work and how something was done, how something should be done, or how something is going. \n\nOften I find myself getting defensive about the way she addresses me and our conversation, and wish I could change the way I respond. I never go out of my way to make her feel bad or dumb, as she is very skilled in our line of work, but sometimes I get a little hot headed. I know my girlfriend sometimes has an issue with keeping work and romance separate, and will address me in a way that makes me feel really disrespected, more like her boyfriend and not like her boss. I have told her many times I do not like this since she is paid so well and I am pinching to pay my bills, while trying to build this business and risk everything I have in the meantime. Sometimes when I feel this feeling my temper gets lit up and gets the best of me, and I slightly yell about demanding respect. This can be over something as little as me saying how I would like a certain thing to be done, and the conversation just snowballs. I want to completely change this about myself, especially if I will soon be responsible for employing several people that *don't* want to have sex with me.\n\nI want to learn how to master conversation with people while in a position of power. I want to build the best team I can, and be the best person I can be. I want to know how to be the bigger person in every conversation, and not let my temper get the best of me. Is there some sort of AI that can argue with me while I attempt to reply in the most constructive way? What are good methods to doing this? Are there life changing books I can read? Do I have to stand in the mirror and argue with myself an hour every day? How do I master the art of being challenged?\n\n  \nThanks",

        "text": "\n\nHi everyone,\nI‚Äôve been working on a framework to help individuals and communities find stability, align with their purpose, and celebrate progress. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been thinking about for a long time, and I‚Äôd love to share it with you and hear your thoughts.\n\nThe world can often feel chaotic, but I believe there‚Äôs a way to create balance by focusing on three key principles: space, time, and matter. Using these, I‚Äôve designed a reward system that motivates progress and aligns people with their goals while reinforcing stability. Here‚Äôs a quick overview:\n\n\nThe Core Concepts\n\n1. Stabilization:\n\nStability is about reducing chaos and finding balance in our thoughts, actions, and environments.\n\nThis happens through alignment with core principles like hope, faith, and memory, which work together to create harmony.\n\n\n2. A Reward System:\n\nRewards tied to space, time, and matter encourage progress:\n\nSpace: Opportunities to explore and grow.\n\nTime: Time to relax, learn, or reflect.\n\nMatter: Tools, resources, or tangible rewards that support your journey.\n\n\n3. Balance Through Pairs:\n\nStability is strongest when paired ideas (like hope and faith) align and reinforce each other.\n\n\nHow It Works\n\n1. Start Small:\n\nReflect on one area of your life where you‚Äôd like to create stability.\n\nTake a small step forward‚Äîsomething as simple as organizing your thoughts or completing a task you‚Äôve been putting off.\n\n\n2. Track Progress:\n\nWrite down your actions and how they make you feel. Celebrate small wins‚Äîprogress doesn‚Äôt have to be huge to matter.\n\n\n3. Reward Yourself:\n\nChoose meaningful rewards that reinforce your efforts:\n\nRelaxation after a productive day.\n\nTime spent learning something new.\n\nA small gift to yourself that supports your growth.\n\n\nWhy I‚Äôm Sharing This\n\nI believe this framework could help people not just find balance in their own lives, but also contribute to a more harmonious and stable world. It‚Äôs a small idea, but it has the potential to grow with the right people and perspectives.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear what you think:\n\nDoes this resonate with you?\n\nHow do you create balance and stability in your life?\n\nWhat kind of rewards motivate you to keep progressing?\n\n\nI‚Äôm just starting to share these ideas, so any feedback, thoughts, or even critiques are welcome. If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you for reading‚ÄîI truly appreciate it. Let‚Äôs work together to create something meaningful.",

During that time, I came to the realization that my hesitation to write wasn‚Äôt about the act itself but about what I feared it might reveal. I was terrified that sharing my stories would expose a lack of depth in my character ‚Äì a feeling I now recognize as both irrational and self-sabotaging.¬†\n\nSo, what am I doing about it?

It didn't help that anyone I tried to connect with in school and other social circles rejected me. Though I'm fairly sure there's been people in my life who genuinely wanted to interact with me, but I thought it was fake or didn't know how to respond to it so they moved on. The few \"friends\" I had in highschool haven't texted me in years, ever since I decided the next conversation we would have is when they text me first. Maybe that's just a typical highschool experience though.\n\nCurrently I work and live at home, yet I still feel invisible. My friend and roommate even gets more attention from my parents and is getting their support going through depression. It's quite possible I'm going through depression as well, but I can't afford therapy (not like it helped in the past anyway), standard solitons aren't available; going outside, exercising, etc. because of limitations due to chronic illness), and I don't want to appear to be attention seeking. \n\nI can't help but wonder why I should care about my life when nobody else seems to actually care deep down. At this point I'm not even the guy people text when they're bored anymore. I'm too much of a coward to even think about taking my own life, but I can't help but wonder how long it could take for things to get bad enough where I start genuinely considering it.\n\nI don't expect anyone to actually read this. I don't have a single friend or family member who would care to hear this, and even though nothing beneficial comes from posting this, I want to give myself once last chance to be heard. If life ever gets too hard to bear it'll be good to know I at least tried something before I try a last resort solution to the problem.\n\nEdit: Reading through others venting and realizing how good I've had it compared to others makes me hate myself for how I'm feeling.",

Nearly everything you describe here fits the neglected child trope: Being confused about social interactions, deciding to wait for ppl to reach out to you first, worrying about coming across as attention-seeking, feeling invisible, not having a foundation of caring about/for yourself & your life, etc. \n\nI‚Äôd recommend continuing to read up on the neglect thing, let the aha moments come to you that way ‚Äî since more active options don‚Äôt seem available to you right now. The book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents was rather cathartic & illuminating for me on this topic. \n\nEven your edit fits this trope. Folks who were neglected in childhood have a less robust sense of self, which leads to heightened comparisons with others (and heightened thoughts of last resort solutions). \n\nFor me, comparing how good I had had it to others only delayed me helping myself by a couple years. Bc at the end of the day, someone having it worse than me didn‚Äôt actually have a droplet of effect on how bad I had it. That‚Äôs not how reality works. You were still neglected, regardless of whatever else you also had going on. \n\nYou‚Äôre just on a different development path than the mainstream, but building a sense of self is still within your grasp. You got this."

When invited to go on a hike or other active activities, I always say yes (this is new for me).\n\n- I‚Äôm incorporating self-care habits like journaling, meditation, good skin care, etc.\n\n- things I want to start doing: learn to play the guitar and spend more time surfing. \n\nMy goal is to become the version of myself that I always wanted to be, and now is the perfect time. I‚Äôm still young, i‚Äôm now single, and have no kids. I think the right person will eventually come along some day, but I‚Äôm doing my part to focus solely on me. I have faith that the rest will fall into place :) hope it helps!"

Yes, I am unproductive because of that, but also LAZY on my own.\n\nI don't look good. I have acne and I am slightly overweight. I am not acting good. I am lazy, which makes me fail in everything and brings my motivation and confidence a lot. My health is a wreck. I have no job because I recently quit one that basically was using me for no pay. I am repeating the 3rd year of college for the second time because I hate the major that I am studying (I do want to finish it tho, for the sense of accomplishment). I am a pushover. I don't get humans. I don't get how this world works and where is my place in it. Cognitively I am failing. My working and short term memory are shit. I don't trust myself and it makes me susceptible to manipulation, because I don't remember anything. I can't even read a simple book anymore. I cannot study. I had a BADDD burnout last year and I still feel consequences of it when I want to do anything productive. I have abusive parents that emotionally destroyed me and made me the victim mentality slave/avoider/insecure/procrastinating/lazy/pressured mess that I am today. I am chronicly tired, both mentally and physically. My adhd messes with me so much. Autism makes me miss out on so much because of the phobias and anxiety that I have when I need to leave the apartment. \n\nI want to be, above all else, HEALTHY AND HAPPY. I have no money for therapist atm. I have no money for expensive doctors, dieticians and expensive private fitness coaches or even group classes. I want to improve my life, I cannot keep living like this.\n\nSo...What to do? How can I completely and utterly focus on myself, without feeling pressured by others? How to not let others and my own limitations in head to stop me from reaching the full potential I know I have? How to take full control of myself and become the best possible version of me there is?

        "text": "Another holiday with the family and it was great. Having Turkey Day on the weekend and doing it way before the actual day was kind of nice. It makes it less awkward if I have any potential work things and I don't have to worry if alternate plans are made on that day. The boss from the meat shop called as well. He asked me if I wanted to pick up some hours and I gladly said I would. He gave me some times and it was nice knowing I would soon have some money under my belt. I would be applying for the same part time job I want in the meantime but this was a nice relief to have. Something guaranteed for a little dough. Today was great. I was going to go to the gym but I did so much more physical activity than I thought. Between playing with my cousins or playing Frisbee or messing around I was exhausted. I also had a cheat day today with the holiday. I wasn't really thinking about my weekly day of the week when it happened but I heard others talk about how holidays and birthdays are also exceptions to them. It makes it so the celebration is more fun for them and they don't have to feel so conscious about the food they have around them. I wanted to follow suit and give myself a celebration. Don't go overboard and stuff myself to the point of feeling gross like too many do, especially on this holiday. I ate what I wanted and felt good about it. Only part about Thanksgiving food that I don't appreciate is that everything feels heavy when eating it. I enjoyed myself though but I know my weekly weigh in will not. If I stay about even this week within a pound or two, then I will be happy. Today was a great day though. I didn't get much sleep again but I didn't let that stop me. I got to my aunt's early in order to see anybody who arrived. I hung out with who was there and my cousins took me out on their side-by-side in the forest. Oh my goodness that was an experience. I haven't done something like that in forever and it felt beautiful. They showed me the mountain range and the beauty of their area and I loved it. We then went back to have lunch/dinner. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal with my large family. After the meal my mom and aunt brought out the cake they worked on to replicate my grandparent‚Äôs wedding cake. It looked really good and my mom did a great job on the cake part. My aunt did the tiering and adding of outside decorations. My aunt then put on a slideshow with music showing memories of my grandparents and their life together. It was very nice and a very good time for everything. After that fun I went on a 4-wheeler with my cousin. Oh my god that was insane. I haven't really experienced something like that before. I got dirt in my face and mouth, we did wheelies, we zoomed across fields as fast as possible, and blitzed uphill. It was a great time but my arms felt like they were going to fall off. Then after that I played Frisbee for a bit before they headed in to get ready to go. I hung out with my cousins long after watching football with them while my one cousin wanted to wrestle with me. By the end of the night, I was both sore and exhausted. I could barely feel my arms but man did I feel good. It was a great day. I couldn't have been happier. \n\nSBIST was a bunch of my family together happy and showing one another love. It was a nice holiday even if my late aunt was not there to celebrate and take her pictures of us. My grandmother and others tried to fill that role as best they could, taking pictures to hold onto the memories. I got to greet people I haven't seen for a bit and I got to play with my cousins I don't always see. People asked me where I was at the meat shop since it is back open. I tried my best to explain it to them and it was hard since I always had to repeat the same story. It's okay though. They can see over the course of time what happens. It was nice though seeing my family together, filling their bellies and smiling. \n\nTomorrow may be a lazy day. I'll have work the following day and a doctor's appointment. Tomorrow I know my arms are going to be sore from all the activities that I had today not thinking they would be that physical. Holding onto another person doing wheelies and going fast really kills your forearms, especially a person that doesn't use their forearms often. I want to go to the gym but I want to rest my arms just in case for work. They could have heavy lifting and I don't want my first day back saying I can't. I'm kind of excited to go back but I'm also excited for the doctor's visit two days from now as well. Either way I got good stuff in my future. Thank you my conjurers of the stuffed faces. I saw what you created today and plenty of people looked satisfied. \n\n",

What's even more astonishing is that I grew up in a pretty racist area, yet I never, ever discriminated against any type of person, because even though I wasn't taught that by anyone, I still felt it in my heart:\n\n\\- like I said - in an area I grew up with, I was pretty isolated because there weren't any kids my age around. Then in third grade, an Algerian kid named Ahmad became my best friend, even though most of the school... didn't treat him fairly to put it that way. Unfortunately, we lost contact due to him moving back home. Love you dude!\n\n\\- then, I moved myself to one of if not THE most dangerous parts of my city, where I eventually became the cool kid (after years of hardship and fighting, physically and mentally), but my crew consisted of nerds who loved wrestling and comics, and also criminals who loved coke and strip clubs.\n\n\\- in high school, I had 7 best friends all in one class, and despite how different we were, we were brothers. We fought amongst each other, but if you messed with one of us, you messed with all of us. The crew consisted of me, a weird heavy metal kid, an alternative romantic, a pilled-out gamer, a psychotic metrosexual, a treacherous womanizer, and two beer-loving football hooligans. To this day, we're like family.\n\n\\- finally, in college I got a few more friends who are still family almost a decade later - a nerdy doctor, an ingenious drug dealer, a SUPER nerdy Spaniard who's passionate about YuGiOh and D&G, an eccentric Chinese teacher, and an incorrigible MMA fighter.\n\nMy point is to never restrict yourself to a certain \"archetype\" of people. Give everyone a chance, because everyone's story can be, in a weird way, a start of a new chapter for you. ",

That's what most people do in most relationships. I like your post because I have found that there are so many different possibilities that people can have in life if we stop aligning and agreeing or resisting and reacting for a second and instead open ourselves up to a completely different possibility that others who are different from us can help us expand to greater possibilities in our own lives‚Äîand even to different realities that can be a contribution! The fear is that others may judge us for choosing outside of the norm. But, the judgments of others do not actually belong to us. They make us contract instead of expand out to greater possibilities. We want to expand out. Therefore, going out of our comfort zones to hear the perspectives of others without judgment is a great way to do that."

One of the worst parts of this is my constant inappropriate laughter that I am completely incapable of supressing no matter what.\n\nWhether it is in a social group, or perhaps in a professional setting, I nonstop chuckle to myself or at times simply burst out laughing at the smallest things possible. It's like while others have the ability to stop themselves, I'm completely incapable of controlling my emotions and getting myself not to start giggling.\n\nThis has led to some people outright labelling me as a weirdo. I'll laugh in the most out of place awkward way possible for no reason. This would be find if it weren't for the fact that this doesn't happen in situations where I am supposed to laugh and only during times where I am placed in a scenario in which it should be forbidden.\n\nThis makes me act in ways that comes off as downright mentally disturbed. I'll simply burst out laughing mid speech, or while someone is saying something to me, simply because I had the most minor thought in my head. Or perhaps someone makes a mistake and says/does something wrong by accident, even that seems to make me start laughing at them in potentially the rudest way possible which ends up hurting and provoking them.\n\nI tried pinching myself, clenching my jaw, pursing my lips, putting bad/negative thoughts into my head. Nothing works. I'll end up one way or another laughing like a hyena or with the stupidest grin on my face while everyone around me is deadpan serious.\n\nWhat can I do with this?",

When you have to take feedback on a constant basis, you THINK that it's people just giving crap about you that they don't like. BUT:\n\nThat's not the right way to think about it. Feedback, in a professional sense, is ***never*** personal. If it's a matter of changing how you communicate, then learn some new ways to communicate. If you're coming off as desperate, then learn patience. Eventually, by working on these aspects of yourself, little by little, you not only get better at the job but also as a person.\n\nAccept criticism and try to learn from it. Any feedback is better than no feedback - it's an opportunity to learn, not a roast.\n\n\\*Also: Learn to listen to the type of feedback that you're given - does it seem personal? Is it unhelpful?\n\nGenerally, feedback that is specific will be FAR better than any general bits. If it's too general and you hear it from only one person, move on with your life. If you hear it from a few people, then it might be a pattern you need to fix\n\nHope this helps and good luck!"

If I do just one of those things I still feel like I've accomplished something and don't feel the guilt and frustration that lead me to giving up before.\n\nThis honestly felt a little dumb at first, like I was tricking my brain by giving it an illusion of choice.

        "text": "We tend to believe that we must commit our precious lives to paying bills and conforming to society's norms. While this is true on the surface, a deeper layer unveils something more profound.\n\nWhen we focus solely on paying bills, we end up in frustration and emptiness. Yet, there is one aspect with tremendous potential to improve every area of your life: communication. Sounds quite inconspicuous, right? But bear with me for a moment.\n\nThere are three critical aspects of communication:\n\n1. **Professional communication**\n2. **Social communication**\n3. **Your inner dialogue**\n\nAll of these aspects go hand in hand. It‚Äôs like an equation: if you improve your ability to resolve conflicts with others, you‚Äôll likely resolve your inner conflicts more effectively as well (subjective assumption).\n\nHere are three ways to enhance your communication:\n\n# 1. Practice Compassion Every Single Day\n\nCompassion means identifying what causes the other person to suffer and genuinely understanding their situation. Why is this so powerful? With practice, you become so skilled that you can discern what others deeply desire. This puts you in a position of strength while allowing you to remain calm and collected in heated situations.\n\nOn the flip side, you‚Äôll start resolving your own inner conflicts by replacing shame and judgment with patience and solutions.\n\n# 2. Read Books and Execute\n\nMany of us suffer from overthinking‚Äîit paralyzes us, drains our energy, and limits our opportunities. Others may find themselves getting angry too quickly over all kinds of situations. These patterns will keep repeating unless we decide taking responsibility to resolve them.\n\nThis is an assignment we can‚Äôt afford to postpone. Books like *Radical Acceptance* by Tara Brach or *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living* by Dale Carnegie have helped many break free from these vicious cycles.\n\n# 3. Create Urgency\n\nIn a dopamine-driven world, creating lasting changes is harder than ever, even when we know it would mean the world to us.\n\nThe better you become at creating urgency around the things you want to make a reality, the more valuable you will be to others‚Äîand ultimately to yourself. Writing down why I want something to change and setting a clear deadline has always been a game-changer for me. It‚Äôs simple, yet incredibly powerful‚Äîit transforms vague intentions into actionable goals.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Why not make this week the turning point? Take charge, and start a new movement in your life!\n\n",

        "text": "Hey y'all,\n\nI'm 23, and back in April, my ex-girlfriend ended our relationship. The details aren't important for this post‚Äîjust know it was the worst pain I've ever felt. Between therapy, hitting the gym, and the usual steps you take to improve yourself, I decided to take the risk of deleting social media and setting a timer for Reddit to avoid doomscrolling.\n\nThis happened during my final year of college, which officially ended yesterday. Every single friend who helped me through this process is active on social media (TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook), and my career requires me to stay informed about current events in my country. Here, we also rely heavily on WhatsApp, but it's usually limited to basic communication, whereas most social interactions happen on the platforms I mentioned earlier.\n\nI had to change how I stayed informed‚Äîturning to news websites, watching TV, and listening to the radio. These also required sharpening my critical thinking skills. However, as a young person, I knew I‚Äôd be missing out on much of what was happening with my closest friends and family. What started as a strategy to forget my ex and avoid the temptation to stalk her turned into one of the best experiences of my life‚Äîand one that truly made me a better person.\n\nHere are some of the lessons I learned over the past seven months. I hope they resonate with you and maybe help you too:\n\n1. Social media use has become a reflex.\n\nIn the first few weeks, I‚Äôd find myself reflexively unlocking my phone to look for Instagram. When I realized it wasn‚Äôt there, it felt like my brain was rewiring itself. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but that realization was eye-opening.\n\n2. What are you sharing, and why?\n\nMy therapist helped me see this clearly. I used to upload random photos of myself posing in front of buildings whenever I traveled. He asked, ‚ÄúIs that the kind of thing you want to share with others? Does it reflect what you truly enjoy?‚Äù\n\nHe was right. While I love traveling, I don‚Äôt care about posting photos of myself. What I actually want to share are the landscapes, the architecture, or even the stray cat that came to say hello. My therapist showed me his Instagram, which featured landscapes, family moments, and pictures of his pets sleeping‚Äîthings he genuinely cared about. That‚Äôs the kind of profile I‚Äôd want, too, if I return to social media.\n\n3. The people who love you will find a way to stay in touch.\n\nI was worried I‚Äôd lose touch with friends, so I told those closest to me about my decision. To my surprise, they made an effort to keep me in the loop. My best friend started sending me memes on WhatsApp. Another friend screenshotted Instagram posts and said, ‚ÄúThis reminded me of you.‚Äù\n\nThose small gestures reminded me that even when we think we‚Äôre alone, the people who truly care about us will find ways to connect.\n\n4. You‚Äôll feel less anxious and sad.\n\nFor me, social media was full of triggers‚Äîthings that reminded me of my ex and caused anxiety. Removing those triggers improved my mood almost immediately. I had more time for hobbies and activities I enjoy.\n\nOf course, I still feel sad sometimes and miss her, but it‚Äôs manageable now. The extra time and mental space allowed me to focus on things that make me genuinely happy.\n\n5. You‚Äôll live in the present.\n\nIt‚Äôs clich√©, but true. The time I spent with my mom, grandparents, and cat became so much more meaningful. I vividly remember their laughter, funny stories, and advice when I was feeling down.\n\nNights out with friends felt amazing, too. Without distractions, I was fully immersed in those moments, appreciating them in ways I hadn‚Äôt before.\n\n\nAs I said, I‚Äôm still navigating this journey and pushing myself to meet new people. It‚Äôs not as easy as I thought, but stepping away from social media was the most transformative part of the process.\n\nWill I return? Probably. But now I understand how to use these platforms intentionally, rather than letting them control me.\n\nI hope this post helps anyone who‚Äôs considering a similar step. Good luck.",

Think about a 4 year college degree. 4 years is a long time to try to accomplish a single goal, so they break it down by years: are you a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior? They measure the credits, each class has a specific number of credits towards getting the degree. That way you can say \"I have 50% of the credits I need to graduate!\" You can mark that on a chart over time, and see your progress. You usually sit down with a professor and figure out the exact set of classes (tasks) to do, in a specific order, to achieve the degree. Other people have done it before you, so you know it can be done. If you take a class that doesn't help towards your degree, that's like working on a task or project that doesn't help accomplish your goal; in college you say \"it was an interesting class, but the credits didn't apply to my degree\". \nWhen you're 10% of the way done with something, it's exciting because you're well on your way! 25%, that's one quarter of the work completed, just do that 3 more times and you're done. 33% is great, two more sets of work like that and it's completed. 50% is exciting, half way done! If I can get that far, I can complete it! I know roughly how much effort it will take to finish, now, there's no mystery to it. 75% feels great. 90% done can be stressful because of how long it's taking, but you're so close, don't stop now, just a little more and you've won! \nAlways try to see the big picture, the overall view of a long term goal. For the big main goal I maintain an excel data set with a graph, update it on the 1st of every month, and tape it to my wall in my home office as tangible inspiration."

It has been two years since it goes this exact way: I try to get onto a dopamine detox, one week passes and I allow myself for a bit of entretainment. Then it explodes and I am just out of self improvement and without thinking about it for a month. I have tried almost everything multiple times. I have started slow by getting easy habits on my checklist, I have started strong cutting almost everythin out, nothing worked.\n\nNowadays I am tired of the dopamine detox and just want to have a nice life without too much phone (2 hours of screentime would be great for me if I could keep it consistently) or computer. Maybe play some videogames but not indulge in them (videogames are something I don't struggle with personally). But it is extremely hard and I fail even more. Just a few days ago I watched porn and after the activity I thought to myself that I wouldn't do it anymore and that from now on I would be a much healthier person. Of course, I know deep down that's a lie. I have said the same thing to myself so many times that every time I start another \"healthy self improvement\" period I have almost zero trust in myself to mantain the good habits.\n\nWell, that same day I tried to keep being healthy but two hours later I was indulging on youtube. This is important, because it has happened to me genuinelly more than 30 times in the last two years. As I was binge watching youtube, I thought that, as I had already broken the new \"healthy\" me, I would, why not, watch some porn. Watching porn is bad, but after doing it, I get this thought of \"okay now I gotta be my best self, this was the last time\". That keeps me motivated the first hour, but I know it's bs. So, what can I do? I am lost and tired in the self improvement world",

It helps you stay on track without feeling like you‚Äôre forcing yourself to be 100% disciplined all day long.\n\nYou‚Äôre not lost. You‚Äôre just figuring it out like everyone else. Start small, take it one step at a time, and don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself."

        "text": "Lost my passion for one of my favorite activities. What now?\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI find myself in a bit of a predicament. I am starting to fall out of love with a hobby that became an obsession: swing dancing. I started dancing consistently in 2022 and loved every moment. I was at a very low point and can definitely say that dancing saved my life. I was going to every event I possibly could for nearly two years and dancing 3-5 times a week. I then got into a relationship this year and took some time away. The relationship ended, and I am back to dancing as much as I used to; however, it just doesn‚Äôt feel as fun or as fulfilling. I am starting to think that I was more addicted to self improvement than actually dancing. \n\nI was a bit of a mess, bordering on incel territory, for quite a while. I realized I just needed friends, a community, and just a way to build up those social skills. I spent so much time building a great circle and my social skills up. I was seeing progress every single week in my dancing, my social skills, and my social circle kept growing. I went from being a borderline incel, to someone who has a wonderful friend group and a wonderful community. \n\nAt this point, I feel like I don‚Äôt have as much exponential self improvement left to do. Because of this, one of my main reasons for taking up dancing is gone. I do genuinely enjoy swing dancing, but I don‚Äôt love the activity as much as I used to since I feel like I‚Äôve grown all I can with this vehicle. I don‚Äôt know if itaking up another hobby is the right move though, because the community is still here and so are my close friends. I can‚Äôt imagine leaving either of those behind. I also can‚Äôt imagine that other hobbies (non dance related anyway) have a community as large or as welcoming as this one. That is very important to me too, and I am not sure of where to even begin looking. \n\nSo here‚Äôs where I am turning to the Internet! \n\nTLDR: I took up dancing but realized that I was more passionate about self improvement than actually dancing. I am falling out of love with the activity because I have improved as much as I could through this vehicle. Should I start looking for another hobby with similar community vibe or is there something else I can do to bring the passion back?\n",

        "text": "Today was a pretty boring day but pretty good at the same time. I mostly focused on hanging around my family while playing with Pok√©mon TCG Pocket. I didn't go to the gym because I was still sore again from pushing but felt good when I pushed. I worked on deleting tabs while also getting some chores done. I wish I could say a bunch happened. I didn't feel too good so I skipped lunch. I'm not sure if cheat days are filling me up extra nowadays. I only had a couple slices of pizza but maybe my body is finally saying it doesn't like that. Either way it was a nice treat the other night and eating less tonight isn't the worst thing. A deficit when I wasn't working out that day feels fine to me. I didn't need all the extra calories since I didn't expend too much energy as well. Tomorrow I have Turkey Day with my family due to family stuff coming up on the actual day. I also am not counting calories on holidays because it's a day to enjoy with myself and family. Special days made even more special by me eating what I want and celebrating with people who bring me joy. Today I had two things happen. My sister, her boyfriend, cousin, and her boyfriend wanted to go out. After my cousin's boyfriend decided not to come, all the plans fell apart. I didn't want to really go anyway and we just had dinner and hung out. My cousin got some much needed rest on our couch since I know she's been really busy. At some point the boss I went to talk to messaged me. By the time I thought to get on it I didn't want to wake him by texting. I also wanted to mull it over. I decided that if he only gives me a few hours then I can still apply to the other part time job I was thinking over. Then I could work on one in my field in the meantime. Get a decent job and get experience in my field plus some money. Then move to the other side of the country in the next couple of years. A plan I have had for the past month and I'm happy about and I can't wait as it is coming to fruition. Here is what I ate:\n\nBreakfast: \n\n1 cup chocolate milk - 140 calories (13 g protein)\n\n187 g of orange - ~100 calories (~1.7 g protein)\n\nSnack:\n\n99 g of banana - ~100 calories (~.7 g protein)\n\nDinner:\n\n¬Ω cup chocolate milk - 70 calories (6.5 g protein)\n\n69 g of noodles - ~100 calories (~5.3 g protein)\n\n409 g of sauce - ~600 calories (33.7 g protein)\n\nSBIST was just the nice feeling of having a good time on a game. I haven't really been focusing too much on playing games but I had a lot of fun playing Pok√©mon TCG Pocket. I think it is a great game to just chill to and work on other stuff in the meantime. A lot of my day was just closing tabs, looking at work ideas, and having fun with Pocket. It was simple but comforting. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a while. I enjoy games like Magic and base Pok√©mon TCG but there are so many cards I don't have. Pocket has given me access since I've now been here since the start. It's fun and I've been loving it. And I don't need to spend money. \n\nTomorrow I am having my family's Thanksgiving and the celebration of my grandparent‚Äôs anniversary. I also need to text the boss a response. I'm not sure what to say because I want the hours but now I have thought about other options. I'll see what he wants and how it plays out. I can't wait to see my cousins and hang out with them. I can't wait to just see people but at the same time it will be bittersweet without my aunt. We will try our best to make the most of it though using her memory to make it better. Thank you my conjurers of the endless plates of food. I'm very lucky to have a roof to eat under and the ability to have easy access to food. \n\n",

Honestly I'm kind of terrified of going in one. My teeth are in horrible shape from years of neglect and I'm addicted to porn to the point I stopped dating because I'm unable to perform with a real person. I have a chance with a beautiful woman a few years older than me but she has her own baggage but I would rather run from responsibility and go home and play video games and watch YouTube. I feel like I've been lying to myself and rationalizing the decisions that are the worst for me. I let it get so bad and just started turning a blind eye to it. Well no more! I need to get myself back on track. Any advice would be appreciated",

I decided I wanted so much more. So I started going back to fitness and getting fit and taking care of myself. Soon I was starting to reflect on what are those things that inspired me such as running, hiking, swimming, cycling, mountain, biking, boxing, etc. It took a few years to get in good shape, but soon I was competing in triathlons and Open water swimming. Now nearly 10 years later, I am competing on a national team for age groupers and have travelled throughout the world for competitions and sports. It might not be the Olympics but to me this is the next best thing. I have made the most audacious and ridiculous goal to become a world champion in my sport for age group. Not that ridiculous when you think about it considering I‚Äôve developed the lifestyle and identity to support that factor. It‚Äôs just a matter of time - ie I will out live the competition.\n\nSo basically what I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs time to start living your life the way you truly imagined it.

Consistently for several weeks - then layer up if needed - so like if you're meditating 3 mins a day, plus journaling 3 lines on a page per day, and in bed by Xpm each night and ready 5 pages of a book. Make sure you're achieving all of these things consistently before you increase the mins meditating, the lines journaling etc etc. \n\nThe rhythm of succeeding every day your commitments creates more motivation whilst you're also doing the work to improve on yourself and it becomes a lifestyle before you know it. Enjoying the journey is a lot easier when you make it achievable instead of striving so far ahead that it becomes hard and overwhelming. \n\nIf you have any questions on this I am actually doing a free accountability Q&A on Wed/Thurs depending on where you are in the world. My messages are open if you're keen and I'll send you the details. \n\nEmma :)"

In relationships, whether with friends or romantic I am often insecure and have a fear of abandonment.

I'm a people pleaser and do not take well to even constructive criticism. \n\nI am the biggest girl in my friend group- I'm not even big, I just have a more full body and muscular legs than them, so I require more calories to be satiated, so I eat more than them and we always eat together so I feel like such a big back next to them. I know my body actually fits me though, it's just that comparison is the thief of joy. I also don't really live for myself. I live through others lives it feels sometimes. I have trouble participating in conversations as well because I feel the need to formulate the perfect reply so that people will like me. I seek acceptance more than I would like to admit. And of course, all these are involved with/lead to overthinking. These are just SOME of my issues. Please share any tips or advice on how I can develop a healthier sense of self.

So the chances are you wouldn't even consider not accepting yourself as there would nothing telling you, or showing you an alternative. Whatever that may be (that you are not enough, too small, too big, too fat, too skinny, not intelligent enough, etc)\n\nThe truth is, nothing is missing. Whatever you admire in another that you think you don't have is merely perception. You own the traits of every single person out there. Those you admire and those you despise. It's that we are often to humble to admit or too proud to see.\n\nSo we get into seeking and avoiding, chasing after that which we fear we will lose or avoiding that which we think we will gain.\n\nWhen you can see that there is nothing to see or try to avoid, you can calm your judgements on yourself\n\nEverything and everyone merely offers feedback which either give you a confirmation or disconfirmation of what you accept or deny in yourself.\n\nIt's all perception ( an interpretation that often is skewed).\n\nThat wealthy person you see with a nice car ( has a hefty debt)  \nThat family with the gorgeous house (don't speak to each other inside)  \nThat girl who is super fit ( is super self-conscious and has a eating disorder)  \nThat career minded individual with a bachelor in whatever (is overworking and getting ill from it)  \nThat couple you see online and walking together on the footpath (could have just made up after a seperation or heated argument or they may be about to have one later that night)\n\nWhen you see both the positive and negative, the support and challenge, both sides you can have equanimity and be less reactive to others and to yourself and in turn have more confidence in who you are because who you are is enough. You are exactly as you are, UNTIL you choose to have a difference experience at which point you may end up doing, giving, having, or being something that OTHERS perceive you as being different to them and to the women you were before.

Every single one of these things were not on purpose and I have apologized and quickly fixed the problem no questions asked.\n\nI‚Äôve now gone the extra mile to change these behaviors. I‚Äôm extra careful not to slam my door, I set a 15 minute timer every morning for when I‚Äôm getting ready as to not take to long, I wake up earlier than everyone else as to not have and scheduling conflicts, and I check the shower and bathroom VERY thoroughly as to make sure I have not left a single strand on the floor and even double check before I leave the house. This is the way it‚Äôs been for some months now.\n\nDespite this these changes my roommate that I share a bathroom with has started to become very passive aggressive with me, especially when I ask her to clean up her hair or remind her to flush the toilet. I‚Äôve been mature about these things and have communicated with her like an adult as well as tried to find solutions to any conflict we might have but she will not cooperate and has even gone as far as becoming petty and straight up snarky. It‚Äôs gotten so frustrating that I even once retaliated to being a little petty back. This was only a one time thing after weeks of dealing with pettiness and I regret it and haven‚Äôt done it since. We are both adults and need to act like it.\n\nAs I said before, I‚Äôve acknowledged my bad habits, apologized, changed my entire routine, and have made sure that these things won‚Äôt happen again. I feel like I have done all I can do and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Is there anything else I can do to improve? I genuinely want to be better.",
