I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.",

Not sure what I expected though.\n\n\nYou exist in this hellhole and you're just like... Chill with it? Like I'm so happy for these people but it's mindblowing! Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.\n\n\nLike logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man.",

And then I'm going to play my favorite playlist on YouTube to make my hellish tasks a little bit fun at least. And finally I'm going to start studying for my Chemistry test -- even if I can only manage to do it for five minutes, that's better than lying in bed like I'm doing right now. And it's happened to me in the past where I started crying because of all the stuff that I procrastinated doing (love cramming before end of year exams), but I forgave myself, because I wasn't going to finish anything otherwise. It's incredibly difficult, but you have to stop thinking about what you could have done, and just focus on what you can do right now -- you have all the power to change that.\n\nMy dad always says that motivation only comes after your first action -- maybe that applies to you too right now. I feel like if I can do a little bit, it might inspire me to do more.\n\nAnyway, all the best to you OP, I know you can tackle whatever it is you want to accomplish <3"

        "text": "Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.\n\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\n\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.\n\nIt's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.\n\nMore than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments. I didn’t expect to get any response. It’s hard to describe, but I feel very moved that there are people out there that I reached in a small way for a short moment of time.",

It didn't help. I didn't enjoy anything, it didn't make me feel any better. It was like I couldn't feel pleasure at all. And all it did was make me exhausted. Now I don't have the willpower to force myself anymore. I just lie in bed, listen to music, watch youtube, etc just like you. I'm scared of trying other things that 'might help' because what if in the end nothing helps? Like the other things I tried before? What if there's nothing left.

They're the ones that invited me and said I'd have a good time. But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here. It feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence.",

But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am.

It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. \n\nSorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.\n\nedit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better.",

It's hard to get out of the spiral of negative thinking. \n\nBut I'm trying to have confidence in the brain's plasticity, kind of like using the placebo affect to my advantage. Every time a negative thought pops into my head, I try to reinforce the neural networks that fight them or dismiss them. \n\nIf you focus on the biological damage caused by the depression, it will only make you more depressed and cause more damage. But if you believe that you can heal, there's a good chance that you will or it will at least keep it from getting worse. Don't underestimate the mind-body connection. \n\nI also try to put more effort into practicing my guitar since playing instruments and listening to music are good for the brain.\n\nTake care 🙂"

So many of us-- myself included-- have either a toxic mindset, or people in our lives who have this toxic mindset, that being depressed is somehow a matter of WILLPOWER. It is NOT. It is a real medical issue for which treatment is needed. \n\nIt's such a shitfest that people with this have to deal with having the struggle CONSTANTLY invalidated. But you guys, let me just tell you, anyone who treats this or you like it's all on your shoulders is a garbage, toxic fool. It's not. MOST people in this thread probably cannot handle this illness alone. I couldn't... and it's ok. It's sooo fucking hard, but it's not your fault, and it's not on you to make it all better either. People need help. Most of us here need some kind of help. \n\nI am getting help at the moment, and I'm grateful for that, although I have to be honest that process is grueling and painful. Sometimes constantly talking to/ exposing your feelings to people is like pulling teeth... but... for me, it's getting somewhere. \n\nMy point is: screw the people who are trying to convince you that this is all on your shoulders, or a matter of willpower, or mindset. This is NOT \"mind over matter\". Anyone who suggests that lacks an understanding of what's actually happening in the brain. \n\nI hope everyone here gets the help they need. <3 Good luck, guys.

        "text": "Update:\n\nSorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. \nI really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \n\nI’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\n\nNext I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. \n\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \n\nI’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \n\nI’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \n\nI’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \n\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \n\nIt just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. \n\nIt’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\n\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",

        "text": "Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.\n\nThe kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of \"you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there\", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.\n\nI've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.\n\nAnd with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.\n\nI wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.\n\nEdit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",

However, there are a couple of things I’ve learnt in my (short) life that has helped me get through life being a queer person. It’s 2:30am, so I’m probably gonna not make sense, so I apologise. \n\nOne thing I heard a lot when my country was deciding to have same sex marriage was “your existence is radical”. You being alive is radical and should be celebrated. You being here while most white Americans finally realise what you have gone through all of your life must be exhausting, but also is powerful. You being here while police brutality is shown by media with no regard to how that impacts black people shows that you are resilient. You existing during all of this is grand thing and shouldn’t be underestimated. \n\nIf you need to take a break from things, please do. The one thing you need to worry about right now is you - these events can actually cause trauma, because the constant viewing of police brutality and the disgraceful acts of the police and the fear for your life and safety is traumatising. And to add depression into that, this period of time is very difficult for you. Allow yourself to be not okay (or whatever feelings you are feeling) and give yourself room to take care of yourself. Even if it’s 10 minutes a day where you do something you enjoy, anything to actively feel better is a really good thing, or even 10 minutes to relax. I heard of an app called liberate that is a meditation app for BIPOC (black/indigenous/people of colour), it might help you. \n\nDoing something that helps you feel better IS doing good in the world. Also, the fact that you are talking about your feelings is a great first step. \n\nAlso, I hope that you know that if you need to talk about it or want resources that might help, I can always help you. \n\nYou are, and will always be, enough."

The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. \n\nGetting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence.",

I used to be able to watch a TV show or movie and care about it, now I have to pause ever 15 or 30 minutes and wait, watching a show or film can take me all day, I just can't bring myself to give a shit about pretend. I loved to read, I read a book a week or more from 8 until 32 years old. For the next 4 years of depression I read 5 books. \n\nAnd in the last 2 years of recovery and therapy things have improved, but more in other ways, now its still only a book every 2 months, wildly different than most of my life. I never did social media at all before I got on Reddit less than 2 years ago, not of any kind. Reddit is different, I still don't do anything else, and I do like it here and the people I have met, but I do notice I am on here 3 to 6 hours every day. I feel like I am coasting intellectually on things I already learned, ideas I already formed, philosophy I already believed, and more than anything thoughts I have already thought. \n\nThis is the thing that is most for me, I am articulate and well read enough, with enough evidence based and fully formed opinions, that I can appear intelligent in all likelihood forever. But that is not the point. Intellect is nothing if one does not grow, does not learn and change, does not reach. It is improving with therapy and such, but in truth it is quite slow. The memory, concentration and motivation issues are incredibly frustrating, it bothers me because I want it and am trying hard, yet redeveloping it is proving so difficult. I wish I had answers besides continuing to move forward and to keep trying things, keeping those that prove effective over time. But its really irritating in truth, I can empathize a great deal."

My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?",

You are still young and you have your degree now. It is fantastic. You have a diploma you were strong enough to go to school everyday with your issues and now you see the results. You have anorexia but you also have the potential to gain weight and to be a healthy person now that you know it. Understand what are your problems and why knowing them isn't going to pull you back but it is how you can see your potential and the things that you have to do now. See all the goods in your life and accept the bad things and the past. You are not alone we are here to hear you and i am ready to talk to you about whatever you want just look at your future for now you have so much to do now.  Leave the past in the past it is hard to say but when someone ask you how was your highschool years just say awful or say it is so far i barely remember it with a joke and that's how i deal with it so try it . Idk if my message was clear but all i want to say is give your present and your future a chance so they can be your new past."

Guys will fucking play me, act all into me at first, and then flip the script and be like “oh srry this ain’t gonna work out, u don’t rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye” (they don’t say that literally but im trying to summarize lol) LIKE WTF?! You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That’s like saying someone with a disability can’t love someone because they’re not “normal”. Tbh I think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets. Since I’m mental and I’ve been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me, and are surprised when I stand up for myself and don’t allow them to do that. Well, screw you and fuck off🖕🏽",

It is hard because unless you have experienced it, you really do not understand what the other person is going through and even then, we all handle things differently.

(not you specifically specifically just in general) \n\nI had a group of friends that were very aware about my depression. Another person in the group also suffered heavily but the difference was that he sought help and medication and went to what we jokingly refer to as the loony bin. They saw him try and they saw that I wasn't. \n\nThey confronted me straight up by saying that they can't help me if I don't want to be helped and it kinda opened my eyes after I lost them. \n\nFew months went by and I saw the difference in the way people treated me when they saw that *at least* I was trying, I wasn't magically healed or less sad, but it made the world of a difference in my relationship with other people who don't understand mental illness or didn't have it themselves.\n\nSo I don't know if this applies to your situation or has any relevance, but this is what I had found out in terms of boys, friends and neurotypical people in my life. Saying it is completely and utterly out of your control isn't wrong but it isn't correct either. Change you environment, change your approach to coping, cut people who hurt you out of your life, seek counseling, try different medications until you find the one that works for you. Because trauma victims usually feel like they deserve these things but they don't. \n\nDon't let anyone walk over you, regardless of the state of your mental health❤️"

        "text": "I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. \n\nI just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. \n\n\nAnyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye\n\nEdit: I’m really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing. 🥰",

                "body": "“Grief coping\n\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\"\n\n [Grief](https://reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/_/c1u0rx2/?context=1) by [/u/GSnow](https://www.reddit.com/u/GSnow)"

This old friend of theirs and his family are my folks people, not mine. We don't have anything in common and I would only feel more lonely there. My mother understood but my parents became very worried. I hadn't opened up about my depression to them until that point. They told me we should talk sometime soon.  \nHowever, not all was bad. After I calmed down, my fiancée told her family would spend Christmas together. Since her mother died some years ago, her brother and father were never around for Christmas. So it was nice that this year her family was going to get together for Xmas after so many time.\n\nI feel way more comfortable around them. I ended up bringing my PS4, we played, had some beers, talked. It was nice. I felt normal again and I think they enjoyed it too. 2019 was a shit year for my fiancée's brother and his wife too."

Unfortunately when people have never experienced depression they often respond in such facile and ignorant ways. \n\nI wish I could have been there w/you to tell that teacher, \"Oh, sorry; the only 'vibes' I'm feeling here are the judgmental and toxic fumes you're emitting right now.\"\n\nSeriously, there's a whole lot of misunderstanding out there about what depression feels like and what it does to the human it's attacking. There's a tendency to think of depression like a garment one could simply choose to take off, or a smell one could simply scrub away with a little elbow grease and gumption. And this ignorance on the part of people who (to their great fortune) don't have to live the experience leads them to say the darndest things in the name of \"helping.\"\n\nSounds as if your teacher's response was, as Shrek might say to Donkey, \"the opposite of help!\"\n\nI agree with u/xdiggertree's sentiments completely. I urge you not to let that one teacher's response discourage you from reaching out again. It can be wonderful to find a community of peers, perhaps like the lovely peers in this forum :) because those who have \"been there\" are often the most capable of holding your experience with the honor and respect it deserves."

Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.\n\nI have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.\n\nThe woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to \"covid.\" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am \"allowed\" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.\n\nEventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.\n\nI decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.\n\nI am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.\n\nI dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.\n\nEdit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you.",

And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.\n\nSo my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.\n\nThis is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.\n\nEdit: I don't know what to say right now... Last time I looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and I was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now I see this... Thank you so much, this means the world to me.",

Having positive thoughts might be the ultimate goal but being able to shift one's perspective to a more neutral approach can be so helpful! It's still hard, of course, and you have to exercise. My therapist taught me this strategy when we were talking about my body issues. I had to describe my body and its parts in front of a mirror, no judging though, only describing. Practicing this strategy does something with your brain – it changes the bad cognitive patterns you developed over time. This is why behavior therapy works. Negative thoughts turn into negative feelings, not the other way around. \n(You probably already know all of this, OP, but if other users want to take a deeper look into how psychological processes and mental illnesses work: this therapeutic intervention is called psychoeducation)\n\nI'm really glad you found a strategy that helped you!! I wish you all the best for your recovery!"

I just feel like a failure and my major is shitty and it won’t get me anything in life because I’m too stupid to do what I dream about doing. and overall I’m a very anxious person who can’t deal with life situations. I worry about everything and can’t do anything by myself. I live in a shitty country with shitty government and people who hate everyone who isn’t a straight, white person. I’m just a piece of shit tbh, my parents deserve a better child. I would be happy to die by an accident so nobody could blame me and wonder what they could have done.  I understand other people have it worse but I’m just really having a very shitty time here on earth and the thought of being alive for let’s say the next 50 years absolutely terrifies me."

I don't know you and im just a stranger on the internet but you came here and had the courage to post that you were struggling. That takes so much courage and by sharing this, you've opened up a part of yourself to be vulnerable with the world. Thank you for trusting this small virtual community with your struggles. We want to be there for you the best we can. How can we help? Maybe we can decrease the pain by 5% just by lending an ear, I would be happy to do that. \n\nJust know you have a virtual community ready to be there if you need it. We can support one another in these extremely difficult times. There is no need to apologize for the pain you are feeling. You are human and sometimes the suffering we endure can feel too much to handle. If you're able, try drinking a cold glass of water slowly. It'll help to slow your mind. Try doodling even if its just lines and create a small masterpiece that can serve as a memory of how you were so courageous in moving past the pain of today. All of this is hard, and if all you could do was sit down and breathe today, thats amazing because inside you won the battle against the darkness today. That in itself deserves a medal of honor. \n\nWe are here for you, friend."

        "title": "My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will \"ruin Christmas\" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",
        "text": "A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. \n\nI thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. \n\nHere's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me \"not having enough social activity\", as \"not having enough will\", and have called my therapy \"a waste of time.\" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. \n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",

PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

        "text": "Hi y’all,\nWell I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.\nI’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.\nI grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.\n So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.\nWhen I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.\nWe kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.\nThen when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.\nBut we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.\nWe graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.\nWhen I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.\nWe were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.\nEveryone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.\nI felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.\nWe were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.\nWe were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.\nIt was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.\nOn Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.\nIt’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).\nI cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.\nSince I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.\nI haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.\nI feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.\nHer parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.\nPeople tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.\nJust before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.\nThe only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).\nI’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.\nI feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",

I think it's helped me a little bit. After reading your story I went to find it and found someone who quoted u/GSnow:\n\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."

Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I\nmessed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head.",

I know some studies say they just act that way because “they get distressed when they’re surrounded by distress,” but even if that’s the case, seeing our feelings affect our seemingly oblivious little animals in any way I think gives us a little sense of purpose and connection."

A lot of people forge amazingly strong connections with pets through their struggles, especially if he's been around 17 years, i can completely understand how heartbreaking it must be for you.\n\nUnfortunately a sad part of owning pets is the fact that their lifespans are typically shorter then ours, its sad that your cats condition is a limbo of sorts, i can see why that must make it so much harder to begin to let go. \n\nAll i can offer is to remember the great times, remember the comfort, that cat has lived a long and happy life with a compasionate owner, even if it has a condition that means it doesn't express the same personality and memory as before. Its difficult to let go of anything that holds a certain emotional place in your mind and life, but in time you'll accept what help he offered, how he held you up, and though hes gone now, those memories will never leave.\n\n Things come and go in life, its part of growing as a person, lifes one big up and down, just keep in mind this will become easier to manage in time"

I guess to me the appeal of death/suicide is that everything stops, I don’t have to feel this way, continue to feel overwhelmed every single day with college, or hate myself. It’s like everything that makes me cry just goes away and will never come back, but I know I would never be able to actually do it so I’m just stuck with the thought. But also like you said, there’s good things in my life too so I can relate but yeah while I don’t daydream of dying I do daydream of what it would be like to disappear; just drop everything I have/do now and just move far away and start this whole new life with a new identity and start fresh. I mean it’s exhausting pretending to be okay whenever I’m a public place like work or school, I smile, high five, and toss jokes around with people but once I’m alone that smile goes away and I look dead."

                "body": "Big trigger warning. I’m going to talk about suicide and the thought process.\n\n\nWhat most of you all are describing is called suicidal ideation or passive suicidal ideation. It’s not quite being passively suicidal but is certainly one of the first steps in that direction. I’m definitely not minimizing anyone’s struggles, I’m posting this as a warning of what to look for, signs you need to reach out for help immediately.\n\nI can help with questions if you want. I’m older now but when I was very young I actively tried to kill myself a few times then was passively suicidal for a very long time after, almost 20 years. Haven’t been suicidal at all for just as long. Got a professional diagnosis and help.\n\nBeing passively suicidal is putting yourself at risk without directly trying to kill yourself. Such as excessive speeding, dangerous biking, finding yourself in dangerous areas of the city at odd hours, participating in crimes, excessive drug/alcohol use, starvation diets, participating in any physically damaging etc... or any combination.\n\nI often didn’t realize the motive behind why I was putting myself in very dangerous situations. I also would rationalize it as something else. I used to think it was just a fascination with what’s “real”, but I would seek out what’s “real” in the form of danger. Another rationalization was that I was “testing” my fear of death, and my ability to feel in general. It wasn’t about dying. The scariest was when I’d have the realization during the event, it having not occurred to me that I was in any danger at all before that moment.\n\nThere were also times when I knew I was rolling the dice and did so willingly. “If I make it, I make it, if not, I don’t”.\n\nIf you have any of these thoughts or have participated in that type of activity please seek help. This lifestyle often leads to someone still wanting to live but dealing with the consequences."

I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. \n\nSo here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.\n\nI would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”",

Grief for the suffering that you've been through, that you will never get those years back.\n\nThe feeling of loss that comes from living with depression for a long time can feel a lot like losing someone close to you. You're grieving for your past self. It's incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact that you are never going to get the chance to live those years of your life in the way that you had hoped to.\n\nLike a lot of people do when they're grieving for a loved one, you're blaming yourself for it. You're not just saying that you feel like your life has gone to waste, you're saying that *you're* wasting it. As though you were given happiness, and discarded it.\n\nBut you can't waste what you weren't given in the first place. You didn't choose to be depressed. You weren't given years filled with happiness that you squandered. Instead, you were given years filled with depression, and yet you've been trying to do whatever you can to try to turn it into a life filled with happiness. That isn't wasting it - that's making the most if it. You're not living the life you hoped to have, but you are living the life that you do have, as best as you can.\n\nIt's true that in time, it's possible to come to accept the loss, and to recover. But that's not where you are right now, or how you're feeling right now, and it's not much comfort to be told that you may eventually feel better when the way you're feeling right now is so overwhelming that it's hard to imagine ever feeling anything else. It's natural to feel that way.\n\nSo cut yourself some slack. You aren't getting that time back, and you aren't going to feel OK about that right away, so try to go easy on yourself when you're already feeling bad enough."

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”"

I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. \n\nI’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. \n\nLove doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.\n\nI tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. \n\nEven the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. \n\nMy mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.\n\nAll this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. \n\nMy only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.\n\nEdit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.\n\nI really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood.",

I have relatives and even grade school bullies who are very successful and comfortable financially with families who I doubt have any remorse or even think about their bully past as they have full lives now. \n\nIt seems to me that a lot of bullies do so precisely bc they know their ‘good life/support system/network’ would never believe it and would let them get away with it. They have everyone in their life believing their a saint, except you have seen the truth. If the bully makes you the scapegoat, gets everyone to look down at you/blame you then in a way it can lift them up socially. Having someone to blame is also a good social insurance policy to take the heat off of them too. \n\nTo give you some comfort, these bullies probably have to keep their ‘social mask’ on constantly and it must be exhausting. \n\nBeing depressed thinking about bullies/the painful past is not serving you now. Don’t let them take up space in your head bc that’s how they keep winning."

Because I’m so afraid of being an inconvenience, I am so used to apologizing for my actions. For me at least, I think it comes from a place of wanting to make sure the other person is happy (with me) and that I want to make sure they know I care about them. My partner, who I have been dating for about 3 years, has a big issue with the way I apologize and honestly I understand the frustration. \n\nThe more I self-reflect, the more I realize the natural instinct to apologize comes from a place of wanting to be loved and accepted/lack of self esteem. Despite the fact that my apologies feel genuine and I truly am sorry, constant apologizing comes off as disingenuous and is incredibly harming to self image. It also does nothing to aid in building self esteem. \n\nI’ve noticed I’ll apologize for things that I wanted to do but I will say sorry out of inconveniencing someone else. This is super problematic because I’m not only coming off as disingenuous, but I’m also devaluing my opinion."

Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. \n\nI laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. \n\nI don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. \n\nIt's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything.

I don't even know why I am on here I do not ever talk about my emotions nor do I ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired I don't know where else to put it... I don't think that I will ever be happy. I don't think I will ever live my life to the fullest. I don't think I'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. I don't think that I will ever amount to anything extraordinary. I don't think I will fulfill the wishes of God or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. I don't think that I will ever love myself. I don't know where else to go.... so I don't go anywhere. I remain here in this stagnant cycle.",

I have been having a lot of emotions like this for a very long time, and I got so sick of it that I just decided that I want to be happy. And I simply just can't think of anything else. I just decided to work towards getting what I want, and staying in the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Staying in the moment\" has been working out pretty well for me. I have had tons of therapists, tons of advice. Nobody really ever put it to me the way I figured it out on my own. That's probably why I have had so many failed attempts at felling better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, the past has to be an occasional reminder on what NOT to do, and the future has to be a loose idea of where you want to land in any area of life. It has never helped me to dwell on the past or future. If I think about the future too much, I get scared that I won't achieve. If I think about the past too much, I feel like a monster due to any past mistakes I may have made, even if they weren't particularly terrible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's soooo much fun battling lifelong depression. But that's just what this is. A neverending battle, like a holy war in your own head. I know that's an exhausting thought, but fighting with a never-ending goal of making yourself happy without hurting others is a battle worth fighting for, at any time, in any situation in my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI might not even go as far as to say \"happy\". To be perfectly honest, I'd like most days to just be \"okay\". Meaning no monolithic feelings of immense pain, and no anxiety of being happy, yet feeling like there is no net and it can all turn into disaster at any moment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, as a man in his 40s searching for a lot of the very same things you are, I can tell you that strangers care. I can also tell you that you don't need anymore knowledge to dig yourself out of this feeling. You have all the knowledge you need if you think about it and be honest with yourself. What you need is some action. Even if it's small actions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust start trying to make your daily life match what you want in your heart. That's all. And in a little bit of time, you will start feeling more \"okay\" days than bad or good. But hopefully, you'll start having more good days too. That's a plus to getting to a baseline of feeling okay. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI won't beg you, but I will comfort you by knowing that you can get there. Just be brave for yourself. Have the courage to push forward and get yourself to that feeling of calm. You'll thank yourself, and a lot of the things you used to think about over and over will fall by the wayside. I promise."

The cycle of introduction and script, only for the inevitable realization that it changes nothing... but people still expect you to either magically change or just accept it and shut up.\n\nThe most accessible part of the system is CBT-obsessed no matter how many times that fails. Because no one can seem to fathom that there's more to life than the negative thoughts they assume you're having (or the stupid chemical imbalance, when they inevitably tell you to go get medicated or zapped).\n\nI saw someone say CBT is about coping, not healing, which is interesting. It might explain why it seems and feels useless to some of us. Besides that therapists can't really do anything about the larger issues, like the crappy, exploitative society we're in. Eh you know the industry loves addressing symptoms rather than problems.\n\nI have not missed therapy during the pandemic. What I've missed is having a live person to talk to for about 45 minutes, even if I'm paying for the privilege."

First I had to find a team that was willing to listen & experiment with my medications & work cooperatively with my other providers & my therapist to figure out how to adjust & tweak things till I started seeing (*and maintaining*) positive results.\n\nEven still I take about 17 pills when I go to bed every night & a few more through the day just to be able to function at a minimally normal level.\n\nI will say, that therapy is key - the medications I take help to stabilize my mental state so I can function enough to manage the basics of my life & give me the time to do the therapeutic work which is helping me heal over time.\n\nI also had to learn to forgive myself & accept the days where I just couldn’t. I learned to do what I could & then tell myself that “*I’ll try again tomorrow*”.\n\nAnother thing that has helped me massively is that I found an opportunity to volunteer to help other people. A lot of my own struggles came from my long history of judging my own worth by my productivity - this made my inability to function even worse.\n\nFor me, I had serious concerns about whether I would ever be able to get back to a place where I could perform at the level I had previously & which formed a significant amount of the foundation of my self esteem.\n\nBeing able to ease into a volunteer situation, where I could show up & help out when I had the spoons, but take a day for myself if I didn’t - gave me both the opportunity to feel like I still had something of value to offer the world, & that on many days, I had a lot more spoons than I thought (*but on some days, I still had none*).\n\nI’ve still got a long way to getting back to something like the person I once was, but I feel like the progress I’ve made since I started volunteering has really made a huge difference.\n\nJust my nickel, ymmv - but remember to be kind to yourself"

I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk.",

        "text": "I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. \nI truly appreciate it.",

People who are not depressed, on the other hand have a knee jerk reaction to thoughts around death... they actively avoid thinking about it, don’t want to talk about it. I had a psych prof who talked about the fact that although we are all going to die some day, it’s such an overwhelming thought that we have coping techniques and kind of denial around the idea of not existing (spirituality etc). I really see it now. People who are not depressed way overreact to hearing about it or talking about it. There’s a post here somewhere about some poor high school kid who tried to talk to his counselor about his depression and suicidal thoughts... and she called an ambulance immediately and got taken to hospital against his will. Got released, but it cost his parents $1000, NOT HELPFUL. I mean, we’re the ones with a diagnosed mental health issue and yet we have to deal with irrational stuff like this. Then the medical community wonders why people won’t seek help. Anyways, talk about it all you want here. Nobody’s gonna trip out"

I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, \"People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?\".  \n&nbsp;\n\nI ask those questions because I'm looking for hope.

The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.\n\nWhile yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times.\n\nIt only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don’t know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.",

        "text": "The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\".\n\nI have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.\n\nI drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\n\nThe everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\n\nIf anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.\n\nPlease help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.\n\nHere are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:\n\n\\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?\n\n\\-How can I keep up or have more energy?\n\n\\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)\n\n\\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression\n\n\\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?\n\n\\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?\n\n\\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: more questions\n\nEdit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.",

It really is hopeful to see that even when you’ve tried your hardest to die the universe is determined for you to live! \nAs for advice, unfortunately I’m not great at that but one thing that helps me a bit is just being outside. Usually I’ll go for a walk but when I don’t have the energy to, just sitting in the sun for a bit energises me somehow and clears my head. Idk it that works for you or if you’ve already tried it but it’s all I’ve got lol. \nI think going back to school is a good idea. If you’re not passionate about what you’re doing, I think you should definitely have a change. As for the stress, I’ve heard nursing school is horrible for stress but if it’s something you’re passionate about I think at the end it’ll be more beneficial for you to do it. And if you end up feeling overwhelmed you can study part time and take it slow so it’s less of a strain on your mental health. I think it might also give you something else to do which could help with your depression a bit. \nAgain, I’m not too sure if my advice helps that much but really just wanted to let you know how amazing it is that you’ve been given another opportunity at life and, even though I don’t know you, I’m proud that you’ve decided to take it :)\nGood luck with everything and I hope you get better!"

                "body": "Question: have you done any blood work to see if everything is okay? Do you have any health issues?\n\nI have experienced severe depression, and treating it only with psychiatric and psychological help was not improving my life. After quite a few doctors I discovered that I have some health issues (inflammation and nervous system issues) that are messing with my ability to absorb nutrients and I need to supplement my diet. Since I started taking my vitamins and supplements, I have way more energy and it’s easier to get motivated to do things.\n\nAnother thing to get more energy is opening your windows. Get at least 20 minutes of sun light everyday. If you live somewhere where this is not an option, I have heard you can find some lights that do the same thing to improve your mood.\n\nThis is a big one: start meditating. This is something that people dismiss as new age bs, and as a skeptical person it took me a while to try. I recommend you to listen to a podcast called “You are not so smart, Episode 061 - mindfulness” to learn about the science behind meditation, and how can it can improve your life. A major thing is that it helps you to concentrate, and depression usually messes up your executive function so you need to regain this ability.\n\nI recommend listening to the podcast as a whole. It talks about behavior and the many bias that we hold, and many times I had great personal insights while listening to it. The other day I wrote a post about positivity bias based on this podcast, feel free to read it if you want. \n\nI also realized that I need to keep my priorities straight. I used to spend way too much time reviving traumatic moments and thinking about issues out of my control, and one day I said “fuck it”. Note that this took me a while to figure out, but I decided that I just need to work with the circumstances I have instead of feeling bad about it. “Everything is going to be okay” is my new mantra when bad thoughts get in my mind.\n\nAlso get a bullet journal. Learn how it works, it’s super helpful to be productive and to see the progress you are making. Write down every single task you accomplished. If even taking a bath is a big deal, put it as a task. Don’t write down too many things at once, slow and steady is the way to go.\nOne thing that I find interesting about bullet journals is that some tasks just drag themselves, and this is your chance to evaluate if you even need to do it in the first place. It’s a great way to think about your own life and goals. If something needs to be done but you are avoiding it, it’s an opportunity to ask yourself why you are avoiding it. Basically, it’s a way to get some perspective on your life."

No one comforted me. No one spoke to me.\n\nMy life on the outside is fine, I don't have any debt, bar my car payments have my own place-it's rented-but it's my own place I share it with my boyfriend who is great, I have a cat I have an awesome job as an estate agent that I love. I'm just so incredibly lonely and I was even before all the lock down and my dad dying. I just can never seem to be happy with anything.\n\nI get gaslighted by my mum because of this she's a boomer and thinks millenials made up depression. 'all your generation are depressed, what do you have to be depressed about, you' re a mess your house is a mess' but then it stops me from getting help because I feel like if I ring the samaritans or other help I'm taking a spot away from someone who needs it.\n\nI don't find the point in anything anymore I don't find enjoyment in anything I don't see a reason to clean up to eat to shower to exercise this has been worsened by the lockdown and working from home. \n\nMy dad dying made it worse to the point where, when people die, life goes on, it feels like it shouldn't when I walked out of the ward in the hospital the hospital was still there there were people walking around the sun still set and rose I still had to go to work I still had to wake up in the morning and it all seemed wrong. \n\nBut it makes me worried about my suicidal thoughts because a lot of people were upset that my dad died but they still carry on with their life, and that makes me think if I die, yeah my mum and my boyfriend would be upset but they would still carry on. Like I have to even though I don't want to. \n\nMy dad suffered with depression he killed himself but not in a sudden way, he was an alcoholic he stopped eating and just drank alcohol and smoked himself to death. I think I get the depression from him. \n\nI don't smoke and I don't drink and I don't do drugs.\n\nI seem to get days where I have a spurt of energy and i need to get everything done during that spurt and then I'm stuck in the rut."

My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing  and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now. This is why I feel that suicide is inevitable for me personally.",

The good can never offset the bad so is better punch out my card and leave this existence for those who really care about it.  \n\nSo try, if you can, stay alive, find meaning, find resolve, if not, there is at least the solace that everybody dies in the end.

And he will have times in life, where he could use a caring figure he has in you. I know how strong the suicidal urges can be, and I know how little to no reason there can be, for staying alive.
